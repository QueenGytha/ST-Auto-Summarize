### Description
- This extension reworks how memory is stored by summarizing each message individually, rather than all at once.
- Summaries are injected into the main prompt at two levels: short-term memory and long-term memory.
- Short-term memory rotates out the most recent message summaries automatically.
- Long-term memory stores summaries of manually-marked messages beyond the short-term limit.
- **Combined summary**: Optionally merges all message summaries into a single, coherent narrative summary, removing repetition and highlighting key events. The combined summary can be injected into the prompt at configurable positions and intervals.
- **Scene summaries**: Optionally generate summaries for scene breaks, with their own prompt, injection, and validation settings.
- **Summary validation**: Optionally validates summaries (regular, combined, and scene) using a second LLM pass to ensure they meet your format and quality criteria.

**Benefits compared to the built-in summarization:**
- Summarizing messages individually (as opposed to all at once) gets more accurate summaries and is less likely to miss details.
- Because memory storage is not handled by an LLM, old summaries will never change over time.
- Each summary is attached to the message it summarizes, so deleting a message removes only the associated memory.
- Short-term memory guarantees that relevant info is always available from the most recent messages, but goes away once no longer relevant according to a set limit.
- Long-term memory allows you to choose which details are important to remember, keeping them available for longer, up to a separate limit.

### Notable Features
- **Configuration profiles**: Save and load different configuration profiles and set one to be auto-loaded for each character or chat.
- **Popout config menu**: Customize summarization settings, injection settings, and auto-summarization message inclusion criteria.
- **Memory editor**: A separate interface for viewing and editing all memories in your chat.
- **Combined summary**: Optionally generate a single narrative summary from all message summaries, with customizable prompt, template, and validation.
- **Scene summaries**: Summarize each scene break as a single summary, with customizable prompt, injection, and validation.
- **Summary validation**: Optionally validate summaries (regular, combined, and scene) using a second LLM pass, with customizable prompt, retries, and preset.
- **Summaries displayed below messages**: Optionally display summaries in small text below each message, colored according to their status:
  - Green: Included in short-term memory
  - Blue: Marked for long-term memory (included in short-term or long-term memory)
  - Red: Marked for long-term memory, but now out of context
  - Grey: Excluded
- **Auto-hide**: Automatically exclude messages older than a configurable threshold.

### Installation and Usage
- Install the extension in ST using the github link: https://github.com/QueenGytha/ST-Auto-Summarize
- To mark a message for long-term memory, click the "brain" icon in the message button menu.
- To re-summarize a message, click the "Quote" icon in the message button menu.
- To edit a summary, click on the summary text directly or click the "pen" icon in the message button menu.
- To perform actions on multiple summaries at once, go to the config and click "Edit Memory". Here you can filter for specific memories or manually select memories to modify.
- To only summarize certain characters in a group chat, open the group chat edit menu and scroll down to the member list. Click the glowing "brain" icon to toggle whether that character will be automatically summarized (if you have auto-summarization enabled).
- To manually add or edit scene breaks, use the scene break button in the message menu (if enabled in settings).

### Custom CSS

You can easily customize the CSS for displayed memories by setting the following variables:
- `--qvink_short`: In short-term memory (default green)
- `--qvink_long`: In long-term memory (default blue)
- `--qvink_old`: Marked for long-term memory, but now out of context (default red)
- `--qvink_excluded`: Manually force-excluded (default dark grey)

Just make sure to use the `!important` directive to override the default styles.  
For example, to color short-term memories yellow and long-term memories black, you would put the following in your "Custom CSS" user settings:
```css
:root {
   --qvink_short: yellow !important;
   --qvink_long: black !important;
}
```

### Tips

Each model is different of course, but here are just some general things that I have found help getting clean summarizations.  
Try them out if you want.

- **Keep it simple**: Longer summary prompts tend to muddy the waters and get less accurate results. Just in general LLMs have trouble with information overload (hence the reason for this extension in the first place).
- **Low temperature**: I like to use a temp of 0 to reduce creativity and just get down to the facts. No need for flowery language.
- **No repetition penalty**: Again, no need for creativity, in fact I want it to repeat what happened.
- **The `{{words}}` macro doesn't always help**: While some models may reign themselves in if you tell them to keep it under X words, LLMs don't have a soul and therefore can't count, so don't bet on it.
- **You can use global macros**: If your summaries aren't using names properly, keep in mind that you can use the `{{char}}` or `{{user}}` macro in the prompt.
- **No need to pause roleplay**: You don't have to include anything like "ignore previous instructions" or "pause your roleplay". The summary prompt is completely independent and will only send what you see in the edit window.
- **I don't recommend reasoning**: Reasoning models can summarize fine, but they do tend to blab for ages which makes summarizing slow, so I wouldn't recommend them for that reason.
- **Save your presets**: If you are using a different completion preset or connection profile for summaries, make sure to save any changes to your regular completion preset or instruct template. When summarizing, the extension has to temporarily switch presets or connection profiles, which will discard any unsaved changes to the one you are currently using.

### Troubleshooting

- **"ForbiddenError: invalid csrf token":** You opened ST in multiple tabs.
- **"Syntax Error: No number after minus sign in JSON at position X":** update your koboldcpp, or try disabling "Request token probabilities".
- **"min new tokens must be in (0, max_new_tokens(X)], got Y":** your model has a minimum token amount, which is conflicting with the max tokens you are using for summarization. Either reduce the minimum token amount for your model (usually in the completion settings), or increase the maximum token length for summarizations.
- **Summaries seem to be continuing the conversation rather than summarizing:** probably an issue with your instruct template.
  - Make sure you are using the correct template for your model, and make sure that system messages are properly distinct from user messages (the summaries use a system prompt).
  - This can be caused by the "System same as user" checkbox in your instruct template settings, which will cause all system messages to be treated like a user - uncheck that if your model can handle it.
  - Some default instruct templates also may not have anything defined for the "System message sequences" field - that should be filled out.
  - You can also try toggling "Nest Message in Summary Prompt" in the settings - some models behave better with this.
- **My jailbreak isn't working:** You'll need to put a jailbreak in the summarization prompt if you want it to be included.
- **The summaries refer to "a person" or "someone" rather than the character by name:** Try using the `{{user}}` or `{{char}}` macros in the summary prompt. There is also a "Message History" setting to include a few previous messages in the summarization prompt to give the model a little more context.
- **The summaries are too long:** You can select a custom completion preset in the settings to use for summarizations, and that can be used to set a maximum token length after which generation will be cut off. You can also use the {{words}} macro in the summarization prompt to try and guide the LLM according to that token length, though LLMs cannot actually count words so it's really just a suggestion.
- **Incomplete sentences aren't getting trimmed even though the option is checked in the advanced formatting settings:** If you are using a different connection profile for summaries, note that instruction templates are part of that so the option needs to be checked in the template used for that connection profile.
- **When I use a different completion preset for summaries, my regular completion preset gets changed after summarizing:** When a summary is generated, we actually have to switch completion presets temporarily which discards any unsaved changes you might have made to your current completion preset. This is just how ST does things. The same applies to connection profiles (which in turn affects instruction templates.)
- **Just updated and things are broken:** try reloading the page first, and make sure you are on the most recent version of ST.

### Known Issues

- When editing a message that already has a memory, the memory displayed below the message does not have the right color. This is just a visual bug, and it will correct itself after the next summarization.
- Validation prompts may have a high false positive rate due to meta-commentary in LLM outputs (see Todo for planned improvements).

---

### Todo
- Auto-hide older than the last X scenes (with error detection if hidden before summarization)
- Automatically detecting when there is a scene change
- Automatically creating and updating lorebooks
- 'Auto' option for injection placement, adjusting based on summary size (tips from https://rentry.org/how2claude#summarization)
- Version the individual/combined summaries, with the option to choose between them. Including some screen for ease of viewing
- The validation prompts have a very large false positive rate, due to meta-commentary eg 'here is the summary:'. Possible solution: convert summaries to JSON objects for ease of validation. This will also be useful later, in portioning out what goes into a summary, vs into a lorebook
- A navigator bar to easily find the various marked scenes
