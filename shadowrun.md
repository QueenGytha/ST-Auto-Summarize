# GENERAL
MLP with a Shadowrun theme. The world is much smaller, so we require less total corps etc, but need to be comprehensive for a campaign in this setting. Government broke down, so can be omitted.

Campaign specific will be handled later, we want to do the background world building


# THE AWAKENING: TECHNOLOGY ENTERS EQUESTRIA

The event known as The Awakening marked the moment when advanced technology first entered the world of My Little Pony. This pivotal shift began not in Equestria, but in the parallel human world connected by the enchanted mirror portal.

While Sunset Shimmer was visiting Equestria, Starlight Glimmer—ever the curious mage—began experimenting with the mirror portal’s magical properties. Her tampering had unforeseen consequences: time in the human world began to flow at a drastically accelerated rate compared to Equestria. What felt like days or weeks in Equestria became decades or even centuries in the human world.

During this period of rapid temporal divergence, the human world underwent a dramatic transformation. Technological progress exploded, unchecked by the usual pace of social or ethical development. The world evolved into a sprawling cyberpunk dystopia, dominated by megacorporations, rampant surveillance, and a stark divide between the privileged and the desperate. Magic, once a myth, was rediscovered and weaponized, fusing with technology to create a society both wondrous and terrifying.

When Sunset Shimmer returned to the human world, she found it unrecognizable—an urban sprawl of neon lights, augmented reality, and omnipresent danger. Realizing the threat this posed to Equestria, Sunset managed to steal blueprints and schematics for much of the new technology, narrowly escaping back through the portal.

Alarmed by Sunset’s revelations and the potential for such technology to disrupt the balance of Equestria, Princess Celestia made a fateful decision. She ordered the mirror portal sealed forever, cutting off all contact with the human world. The knowledge Sunset brought back became the foundation for Equestria’s own technological revolution, but also a source of fear and conflict as the ponies struggled to adapt to a rapidly changing world.

The Awakening thus stands as the catalyst for Equestria’s transformation into a world where magic and technology are inextricably linked—and where the shadow of the human world’s mistakes looms ever larger.

## THE BREAKDOWN OF THE DIARCHY

With the arrival of advanced technology in Equestria, the once-unified rule of Princess Celestia and Princess Luna began to fracture. The sisters found themselves at odds over how to integrate this new power into their world.

Celestia, ever the idealist, saw technology as a tool to better understand and expand the use of magic. Its analytical capabilities enabled breakthroughs in magical research, leading to the discovery that magic could be accessed through natural focal points rarely developed in all species—not just unicorn horns. This allowed earth ponies, pegasi, and even other races to use magic.

Luna, in contrast, embraced the efficiency and control that technology offered. She advocated for widespread adoption, even at the cost of personal privacy and traditional freedoms. Luna’s vision was a society where data and surveillance ensured order, and she was willing to sacrifice individual rights for what she saw as the greater good.

The rift between them deepened with the introduction of SINs (System Identification Numbers)—a universal digital identity system. Luna championed SINs as a way to bring security and structure to a rapidly changing world, but Celestia saw them as a threat to personal liberty and a step toward corporate and bureaucratic overreach.

As the diarchy fractured, both sisters withdrew from direct rule and instead founded their own organizations to pursue their visions for Equestria’s future. Celestia established Solaris Arcana, a corporation dedicated to magical research, solar energy, and the ethical advancement of magic and technology. Luna, meanwhile, founded Nocturne Dataworks, focusing on matrix technology, data management, and the infrastructure of the new digital society. These two corporations became the first true megacorporations, setting the precedent for others to follow and accelerating the shift from royal governance to corporate rule.

As megacorporations rose in power, exploiting both magic and technology, the authority of the princesses waned. Celestia focused on magical research and guiding those who sought her wisdom, while Luna aligned herself with the emerging technocratic elite, becoming a patron of the new order.

The age of princesses gave way to the age of corporations, with the sisters’ legacy living on in the competing philosophies—and rival corporations—that shaped the new Equestria.


# LIFE IN THE HIVE: THE REFORMED CHANGELINGS

Most reformed changelings still remain together within the reformed hive under Thorax. No longer a grand citadel, the hive now occupies a neglected, rundown district on the fringes of Equestria—a slum where the light of harmony rarely reaches. This area is marked by crumbling buildings, makeshift shelters, and a sense of abandonment. Here, the changelings struggle with the loss of their hive mind and old feeding methods, many turning to BTLs (Better-Than-Life chips) and other forms of escapism to fill the void. Communal spaces have become gathering points for the lost and addicted. Some changelings desperately seek new ways to connect, forming support groups or small collectives, while others spiral into self-destruction, haunted by memories of the hive's embrace.

# OUTCASTS AND SURVIVORS

A minority of reformed changelings could not find solace even within the new hive. These outcasts wander the margins of pony society, often distrusted by ponies and rejected by their own kind. Some try to integrate, taking on odd jobs or hiding their true nature, while others band together in the shadows, forming new tribes or syndicates. They are survivors—resourceful, wary, and always searching for a place to belong. Their struggles are marked by a sense of being caught between worlds and identities, forever changed by what they have lost.

They control a network of bunraku parlors (mind-controlled puppet brothels and entertainment dens), information brokering, and extortion rackets. The Syndicate thrives in the shadows, sowing distrust and chaos among rivals while remaining nearly impossible to root out. Loyalty is enforced through fear and magical compulsion, and betrayal is met with swift, merciless retribution. The reformed changelings under Thorax are considered traitors and are targeted for sabotage or abduction whenever possible. The Syndicate’s ultimate goal is power through subversion, feeding on the emotional energy of a fractured society.

It is known for its transparency, academic partnerships, and efforts to keep magic accessible to all races. Solaris Arcana often acts as a counterbalance to the more technocratic and controlling megacorps, advocating for responsible use of both magic and technology.) |
| Luna         | Nocturne Dataworks      | (Matrix & Technology. Established by Luna as the first true tech megacorp, Nocturne Dataworks controls much of Equestria's digital infrastructure, data management, and surveillance networks. The company is synonymous with the rise of the matrix, digital identity (SINs), and the normalization of data-driven governance. Nocturne Dataworks is both feared and respected for its reach, efficiency, and willingness to push the boundaries of privacy and control in pursuit of order.) |
| Cadance      | Crystal Communications Consortium | (Media & Social Networks. Founded by Cadance, the CCC dominates Equestria's media landscape, controlling news, entertainment, and the most popular social networks. Its flagship product is a ubiquitous dating app that secretly serves as a data mining and blackmail operation. The Consortium is known for its subtle influence, shaping public opinion, manipulating trends, and gathering leverage on both corporate and political rivals. While it presents a friendly, community-focused image, its true power lies in information control and social engineering.) |
| Ember        | Dracoguard Solutions    | (Weapons, Security.

FlimFlam is infamous for aggressive patent trolling, rapid prototyping, and releasing untested products to market—often with spectacular (and sometimes disastrous) results. Their labs churn out everything from performance enhancers and mood stabilizers to questionable cyberware and black market gene mods. The company is a haven for mad scientists, con artists, and desperate innovators, thriving on loopholes, legal gray areas, and relentless self-promotion. FlimFlam's products are everywhere, but so are the lawsuits and urban legends about their side effects. Their motto: 'If it works, it's FlimFlam!' ) |
| Zecora       | Zamani Agriworks        | (Agriculture, blood magic) - As Equestria's cities expanded and arable land vanished beneath concrete, most food production was outsourced to Zebrica. Zamani Agriworks, founded by Zecora, rapidly industrialized the region, transforming Zebrica's once-wild savannas into endless plantations and factory farms. The native zebras, lacking the technological and political power of Equestria, were subjugated—many forced into labor or used as raw material for Zamani's infamous blood magic rituals that supercharge crop yields. Zamani Agriworks is notorious for its ruthless efficiency, environmental devastation, and the creation of a permanent underclass among the zebras. Equestria's dependence on imported food gives Zamani immense leverage over the megacities, making it a silent but unassailable power in the corporate landscape.) |

**Crystal Communications Consortium:**
Cadance established the CCC to foster connection and harmony in a rapidly fragmenting society, but the company quickly grew into the undisputed giant of media and social technology. The Consortium’s platforms are everywhere—news, entertainment, messaging, and especially its famous dating app, which is as much a tool for surveillance and blackmail as it is for romance. Behind its polished, friendly image, the CCC is a master of information warfare, using its vast data troves to manipulate public sentiment, influence elections, and maintain its dominance in the corporate world. Its reach is so pervasive that few secrets remain hidden from its algorithms, and many owe their fortunes—or their ruin—to the Consortium’s unseen hand.

**Dracoguard Solutions:**
Dracoguard Solutions was born from Ember’s vision of giving dragons a new place in the world order—one where their strength and martial prowess could be leveraged for profit and influence. The company quickly became the go-to source for private armies, high-end weapons, and security services, employing not only dragons but also other species seeking a place in the new corporate hierarchy. Dracoguard’s reputation is built on reliability, raw power, and a strict code of conduct that values loyalty and results above all. Their presence is a deterrent in any conflict, and their contracts are often the deciding factor in corporate wars, shadowruns, and high-stakes negotiations across Equestria and beyond.

**Zamani Agriworks:**
Headquarters: Zebrica. Once a land of untamed wilderness and tribal communities, Zebrica is now dominated by the sprawling industrial plantations of Zamani Agriworks. Towering arcologies and blood magic-powered irrigation systems stretch to the horizon, worked by legions of native zebras under corporate control. The region is a patchwork of security zones, research labs, and processing plants, all feeding Equestria's insatiable urban population. The environmental and social cost is staggering, but Equestria's megacities remain dependent on Zamani's food shipments—and the zebras' plight is largely ignored by the corporate elite.

**Griffons:**
Griffons are known for their sharp business acumen, but also for their reputation as greedy, self-serving merchants. Their society is fiercely individualistic and transactional. Trust is rare, and every deal is an opportunity for personal gain. While some griffons have found success as fixers, smugglers, or black market brokers, most scrape by in a harsh, competitive environment where only the cunning thrive.

**Griffonstone:**
Once a proud city perched atop the mountains, Griffonstone has fallen into ruin and poverty. It is now a dense, lawless metropolis where the infrastructure is crumbling, government is absent, and survival depends on wit and hustle. The city is a patchwork of makeshift markets, shantytowns, and decaying colonial architecture. Commerce is king, but it is driven by desperation and opportunism. Merchants, fixers, and smugglers rule the streets, and every transaction is a gamble. Despite the squalor, Griffonstone remains a vital hub for illicit trade, rare magical artifacts, and shadowy deals that the megacorps would rather ignore.

## The Verdant Wave
A radical eco-terrorist faction led by Tree Hugger, The Verdant Wave is dedicated to sabotaging the industrial and magical exploitation of nature by the megacorps. Rejecting both technological and magical abuses, they use a mix of druidic magic, guerrilla tactics, and subversive activism to disrupt supply chains, destroy polluting facilities, and liberate exploited creatures. The group operates in cells, communicating through coded natural signs and astral messages. While some see them as misguided extremists, others view them as the last true defenders of the wild. Their actions range from nonviolent protest to direct action and sabotage, and they are known for leaving behind living art installations as a calling card. The Verdant Wave is fiercely anti-corporate, and their ultimate goal is to restore balance between civilization and the natural world—by any means necessary.
