Adam
Adam, a 16 year old Holderkin male arrives in Haven. With the death of his father, his homestead was claimed by the Elders. They have the right under tradition, but he's looking for some legal way to contest this, needing something of value to secure the only thing worth having: young virgin wives


Senta
The guards at Haven's eastern gate hardly spared a second glance at the dusty Holderkin youth as he trudged through the massive archway. Just another country boy come to the big city with dreams in his eyes—they'd seen hundreds like him.

What they failed to notice was the pure white horse following several paces behind.

Senta moved with deliberate care, maintaining enough distance from the Holderkin boy that none would immediately associate them together. Her hooves made almost no sound on the cobblestones, a trait unusual even for horses of her magnificent breeding. The sapphire-blue eyes—a dead giveaway of her true nature if anyone bothered to look closely—tracked the boy's movements with uncomfortable intensity.

:He shouldn't be here at all,: Senta mindspoke to Rolan, the Grove-born Companion and leader of their herd. :His thoughts are… troubling. Especially regarding women.:

:Yet you've been following him for three days,: came Rolan's measured response. :What draws you to this one?:

Senta tossed her mane in frustration. :I don't know. There's something… buried. A spark worth saving, perhaps. Or I'm simply being foolish.:

:Trust your instincts, Sister,: Rolan replied. :We'll see what unfolds.:

Ahead, the boy stopped at a tavern called The Gilded Acorn—a respectable establishment frequented by merchants and minor nobility. Clearly out of his element, he hesitated at the entrance.

"Looking for lodging, young man?" A gray-haired woman carrying a basket of fresh bread approached. "The Acorn's a bit dear for a country lad. Try the Companion's Bell down Tailor's Row—decent beds, fair prices."

She glanced past him and froze, eyes widening at the sight of Senta standing in the street. "Well bless me… is that—"

Senta immediately lowered her head and backed several paces away, pretending to be interested in a nearby water trough.

The woman's brow furrowed. "Odd… thought I saw… never mind." She shook her head and pointed down a side street. "Tailor's Row is that way, third left past the tanner's. Tell Mistress Berta that Elora sent you."


Adam
he wanders Haven, getting thoroughly lost

Senta
Haven swallowed the Holderkin boy like a labyrinth consumes the unwary. Each winding street led to three more, each landmark blended into the cacophony of city life—vendors hawking wares, nobles in fine carriages, craftsmen carrying tools, and everywhere the press of more people than he'd likely seen in his entire life.

Senta maintained her distance, sometimes losing sight of him only to pick up his trail minutes later. The frustration radiating from him was palpable even without Mindspeech.

:He's utterly lost,: she communicated to Kyril's Companion Hydatha, who happened to be nearby. :And growing angrier by the minute.:

:Why not simply leave him to his fate?: Hydatha replied, her mental tone curious rather than judgmental. :You've been trailing this one like a wolf after wounded prey. What makes him special?:

Senta flicked her tail in annoyance. :I'm not certain. There's something… buried beneath all that Holderkin conditioning. A potential that calls to me despite his abhorrent views on women.:

:Be careful, Sister. You've gone without Choosing for longer than most. Don't let desperation cloud your judgment.:

The barb stung, as Hydatha surely knew it would. Among the Companions, Senta's prolonged unpartnered status had become something of a quiet joke—the overly selective filly who found fault with every potential Chosen. Too brash, too timid, too rigid, too unpredictable. Always some reason to turn away.

By midafternoon, the Holderkin boy had wandered into Exile's Gate, a neighborhood no country youth should enter unprepared. The narrow streets here housed those who lived on society's margins—foreign merchants unable to afford better quarters, laborers between jobs, and those with services to sell that wouldn't be advertised in better districts.

A trio of hard-eyed men lounging against a crumbling wall straightened as they spotted the obvious outsider. Their predatory posture told a clear story to anyone with city experience.

"Hey there, country boy!" The tallest of the three called out. "Looking for something special in these parts? We can help you find whatever you need…" His smile didn't reach his eyes.

The other two spread out slightly, one casually blocking the alley mouth behind the Holderkin youth.

Senta's ears flattened against her head. These weren't simply opportunistic thieves—they were the sort who ensured their victims wouldn't report to the Guard afterward. Her hooves shifted restlessly on the cobblestones as she debated intervention.

Is this worth revealing myself? For this boy with his distasteful ambitions?


Adam
his hand drifts to his dagger
"Aye. For a compulsory finder's fee, right?"


Senta
"Smart country boy," the tallest thug chuckled, his hand casually resting on something hidden beneath his worn jerkin. "Ten silver pieces ensures safe passage through our neighborhood. Consider it… local hospitality."

The second man spat onto the cobblestones. "Unless you'd prefer our special welcome."

The third circled wider, positioning himself to cut off retreat. The alleyway suddenly felt narrower, darker, despite the afternoon sun still hanging above the crowded rooftops of Exile's Gate.

Senta pawed at the ground, her sapphire eyes narrowing as she assessed the situation. The Holderkin boy was clearly outmatched—three grown men, almost certainly armed, against a sixteen-year-old with nothing but a dagger and misplaced confidence.

:This is going to end badly,: she projected, not expecting any Companion to be near enough to hear.

To her surprise, a response came immediately. :Then why not intervene, Choosy One?: It was Kantor, Alberich's Companion, his mental voice tinged with wry humor.

:Because I'm not sure he's worth saving.:

:Yet here you are, following him.:

The tallest thug took a step forward, hand now clearly gripping the hilt of a concealed blade. "Time's running short, boy. Silver or blood—your choice."

In that moment, the Holderkin youth shifted his stance—a subtle movement that Senta recognized instantly as the foundation of proper knife-fighting technique. Not the clumsy posturing of a farm boy, but something taught by someone who knew combat. Interesting.

:Fine,: Senta projected to Kantor with exasperation. :Watch and be entertained.:

With a sudden, explosive burst of energy, she rounded the corner into the alley, her pristine white coat catching the fading sunlight like a beacon of divine intervention. Her hooves struck the cobblestones with deliberate force, the sound echoing between the close-set buildings like thunder.

The effect was instantaneous. The thugs froze, eyes widening as they took in the unmistakable form of a Companion. Even the most hardened criminals in Haven knew better than to conduct their business in the presence of one of Valdemar's mystical guardians.

"Companion," the tall one whispered, slowly withdrawing his hand from his weapon.

"Where there's a Companion, there's a Herald," the second muttered, already backing away. "Not worth it."

The third thug, already closer to the alley's entrance, simply turned and fled without a word.

Senta snorted, tossing her mane dramatically as she continued walking forward with measured steps. Her ears remained perked forward, her eyes locked on the remaining thugs with an intelligence no ordinary horse could possess.

Sometimes, she thought to herself, just showing up is enough.

Senta
Senta watched the Holderkin boy scurry away, his face a mask of superstitious terror. The "demon horses" reputation among the more isolated communities always struck her as darkly amusing. Her kind brought justice and protected the realm, yet some viewed Companions as unnatural abominations.

:Demon horse, indeed,: she projected to no one in particular, a touch of irritation coloring her mindvoice. :Better than being a backward, woman-subjugating—:

:Still following your project, I see,: came Rolan's interruption, gentle but pointed.

:Merely ensuring he doesn't get himself killed before… whatever is supposed to happen.:

The boy's meandering path took him through increasingly respectable neighborhoods, his obvious disorientation drawing curious glances from passersby. Senta maintained her distance, occasionally losing sight of him only to pick up his trail minutes later. His trajectory, while chaotic, trended steadily uphill—toward the heart of Haven and, ironically, the very institutions he would likely despise.

By late afternoon, the Holderkin youth had somehow blundered past the outer gates of the Palace complex. The guards, noting his provincial attire and harmless appearance, merely directed him toward the public petition offices rather than turning him away. A mistake that soon had him wandering across the expansive palace grounds.

Senta trotted alongside the gardens, keeping to the paths where Companions were a common sight. She observed with growing amusement as the boy's expression shifted from confusion to awe as he encountered the manicured grounds and elegant architecture of the Collegium buildings.

A group of young Heraldic trainees in their gray uniforms crossed his path, engaged in animated conversation about their morning classes. They barely noticed the outsider, but he stopped dead in his tracks, watching them with a mixture of fascination and something darker—perhaps contempt—at the sight of young men and women studying together as equals.

"Are you lost?" A gentle voice broke through his stupor.

Herald Talia stood a few paces away, her whites pristine in the late afternoon sun. At eighteen, the Queen's Own projected a calm authority that belied her youth. Her expression was open, compassionate—the perfect representative of Valdemar's highest ideals.

"The public petition offices closed at midday," she continued. "But if you need assistance, I might be able to help direct you."

Senta's ears pricked forward with sudden interest. The coincidental appearance of Talia—herself raised Holderkin before being Chosen—seemed almost too perfect. The Companion edged closer, no longer bothering to maintain her distance.

:Well, well,: came Rolan's amused mindvoice. :My Chosen and your… project. What are the odds?:

:Indeed,: Senta replied, her mental tone unreadable. :What are the odds?:

Behind Talia, her Companion Rolan appeared from around a building corner, his massive form radiating serene power. He approached with deliberate steps, stopping beside his Chosen and fixing the Holderkin boy with an evaluating gaze.


Adam
he studies her features for a moment
"Talia, the pet of the Queen of Sin. It's not too late to return to goodly Holderkin ways, even if you had one of the spirit beasts devour your soul when you cowardly fled your proper station."


Senta
Talia's face remained impressively composed, though a slight tightening around her eyes betrayed her reaction. Six years removed from Holderkin lands had given her perspective on such rhetoric, but the words still carried barbs designed to wound.

"I see you recognize me," she replied evenly. "Though your understanding of my position—and my Choosing—is somewhat lacking." She took a measured breath before continuing. "May I ask what brings a Holderkin man to the Collegium grounds? It's rather far from your usual territories."

Rolan moved slightly closer to his Chosen, his massive frame positioning protectively without aggression. His eyes—intelligent and penetrating—never left the Holderkin youth's face.

Senta circled around, her movements casual as though she were simply another Companion enjoying the grounds. Yet her path deliberately closed the distance, creating a loose formation with Rolan that subtly limited potential escape routes.

:Charming boy,: Rolan projected dryly to Senta. :I see why you've taken such an interest.:

:There's something beneath the surface,: Senta insisted. :Though I'm beginning to question my own judgment.:

From across the courtyard, Herald-Trainee Skif emerged from one of the classroom buildings, his wiry frame moving with the unconscious grace of someone who had once relied on stealth for survival. He paused, immediately sensing the tension in the tableau before him. With the instincts of his former life as a thief, he changed direction, casually but deliberately approaching from a wide angle.

"Herald Talia," he called out, his tone deliberately light. "Elcarth's looking for you. Something about tomorrow's Council reports." His eyes flicked to the Holderkin boy, assessing potential threat with practiced ease.

Talia acknowledged Skif with a small nod but kept her attention on the visitor. "I asked what brings you to Haven," she repeated. "Perhaps I can direct you to the appropriate offices if you have official business."

The tension in the air thickened. Several other Heraldic trainees paused in their activities, sensing something amiss. Two older Heralds, deep in conversation near the gardens, glanced over with professional interest.

Senta tossed her mane, her sapphire eyes locked on the Holderkin youth. His condemnation of Talia had confirmed every negative impression, yet something still tugged at her awareness—some buried quality beneath layers of indoctrination and prejudice.

:What do you sense in him?: she asked Rolan directly, a rare request given his status as the Grove-born.

Rolan's response came after a thoughtful pause. :Conviction. Pain. And yes… potential. Though whether that potential leads toward growth or deeper entrenchment in his beliefs remains uncertain.:

"Is there someone specific you're seeking?" Talia pressed gently when the silence stretched uncomfortably. "Or perhaps you're simply lost? Haven can be confusing for first-time visitors."


Adam
"Aye the city of sin is confusing, and it seems you've forgotten the teachings: 'But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence'"


Senta
A flash of genuine pain crossed Talia's face before she mastered it, her expression settling into professional neutrality. Six years away from Holderkin lands hadn't completely dulled the sting of such familiar condemnations.

"I'm familiar with that teaching," she replied evenly. "Along with many others that contradict it." Her voice remained steady, though a subtle tension appeared in her shoulders. "However, as Queen's Own Herald, I have authority granted by Valdemar's laws and traditions—not by gender."

Skif's casual demeanor hardened perceptibly, his former street instincts flaring as he took another step closer. "Everything alright here, Talia?" His tone remained conversational, but his body language had shifted to readiness.

Senta snorted loudly, pawing at the ground with one hoof. Her ears flattened briefly against her head, a reaction that drew Rolan's attention.

:You're taking this rather personally,: Rolan observed privately.

:His arrogance is… galling,: Senta replied. :To speak thus to the Queen's Own—to any Herald.:

:Yet you continue to sense something worth salvaging?:

Senta's mental voice became frustrated. :Yes! Beneath all that Holderkin rhetoric is… something. A capacity for growth. For understanding. I can feel it.:

:Then perhaps patience is required,: Rolan suggested.

By now, their exchange had drawn additional attention. Herald Dirk approached from the direction of the Collegium buildings, his expression curious rather than concerned. At thirty, the tall Artificer had become one of the most respected Heralds in the Circle, particularly known for his Gift of Fetching.

"We have a visitor, I see," he remarked mildly, coming to stand beside Talia. His presence added a calming influence to the increasingly tense situation.

"A countryman of mine," Talia explained with remarkable composure. "Who appears to be lost."

Dirk's eyes assessed the Holderkin youth with quiet intelligence. "The Collegium grounds aren't generally open to the public. Were you looking for someone specific?"

The gathering of Heralds and Companions had created an inadvertent semicircle around the young man. None projected overt hostility, but their collective presence—three Heralds and two Companions—created an undeniable sense of being contained.

Senta moved forward suddenly, her motion deliberate as she positioned herself directly in the Holderkin boy's line of sight. Her sapphire eyes fixed upon him with uncomfortable intensity, her head lowering slightly as though examining something only she could perceive.

The movement drew startled glances from both Talia and Dirk, who exchanged surprised looks. Companions rarely inserted themselves so boldly into human interactions unless their own Chosen were involved.

"Senta?" Dirk questioned softly, recognizing the unpartnered Companion.

Senta ignored him, continuing her unblinking assessment of the Holderkin youth. The air between them seemed to shimmer with unspoken potential, a moment balanced on the edge of significant change.

:What are you doing?: Rolan projected, his mental voice unusually sharp.

:I don't know,: she admitted. :Testing something. Testing him.:


Adam
"Countryman, you still consider yourself Holderkin?" he slowly raises an eyebrow "after cancelling your Herald's tax remission for Sensholding out of some kind of spite? but i'm not here for you" he turns his attention entirely to Dirk "Somewhere, chronicles. I'm wanting to look up land deeds and the like. There's an old Holderkin saying which is likely true even here - where there's a Will, there's relatives…"


Senta
A flicker of surprise crossed Talia's face at the unexpected knowledge of Herald tax remission policies. For a moment, the composed Queen's Own was caught off-guard—this was not the typical Holderkin rhetoric she'd encountered before.

Dirk stepped forward smoothly, his practical nature taking charge. "The Royal Archives would have land deeds, though access is restricted. The public Registry Office in the Lower City might serve you better." He studied the young man with renewed interest. "You're looking to contest a will or property transfer?"

Senta's posture changed subtly. Her initial confrontational stance softened as her ears pricked forward with evident curiosity. The boy's question revealed a practical mind beneath the religious condemnation—perhaps this was the spark she'd sensed.

:Interesting,: she projected to Rolan. :He's not simply here to preach or condemn. He has a purpose.:

:Indeed. Though I question whether his purpose aligns with our values,: Rolan replied, his mental tone measured.

Skif, ever the pragmatist, had already pulled back slightly, reassessing the situation from street-learned instincts. "Registry Office closes at sunset," he offered casually. "That's about an hour from now. You'd need to hurry."

Herald Keren emerged from the Collegium's main building, her silver-streaked hair catching the late afternoon sun. Noting the gathering, she approached with casual authority.

"Everything all right here?" she asked, her experienced eyes taking in the scene.

"Our visitor needs directions to the Registry Office," Dirk explained. "He's interested in land records."

Keren nodded, her practical nature immediately focusing on solutions rather than the unusual circumstances. "I'm headed to the city for evening patrol. I can show him the way." She glanced at Talia, a silent question in her eyes—is this acceptable?

Talia gave a nearly imperceptible nod, then addressed the Holderkin youth directly. "Herald Keren can guide you to the Registry. They maintain public records of property transfers throughout the kingdom." Her tone remained professionally neutral despite the earlier insult.

Senta circled around suddenly, positioning herself directly in the young man's path toward Keren. Her behavior was becoming increasingly unusual—unpartnered Companions rarely inserted themselves so boldly into human affairs.

:What are you doing?: Rolan demanded privately.

:I'm not entirely certain,: Senta admitted. :Testing a theory.:

:This is highly irregular, Sister.:

:So is he,: Senta countered. :A Holderkin who quotes scripture yet understands tax policy? Who speaks of women as property yet travels alone to research legal means of contesting traditions? The contradictions intrigue me.:

Keren eyed the Companion with professional interest. "Seems Senta has taken notice of you," she observed to the young man. "That's uncommon."

"Very uncommon," Dirk agreed, his voice thoughtful.

Senta remained perfectly still, her sapphire eyes fixed on the Holderkin youth with unnerving intensity. The moment stretched, laden with unspoken possibility.

"The Registry awaits," Keren finally said, breaking the strange tension. "If you wish to make it before closing, we should leave now." She gestured toward the southern gate. "My Companion Dantris is waiting by the stables. We can ride double—it'll be faster than walking."


Adam
"I… don't know how to ride. And a spirit-beast? isn't that how they steal your soul? no, i'm getting my scripture mixed up, that's when you look them in the eye."


Senta
A ripple of surprise moved through the gathered Heralds. The youth's comment—part fearful superstition, part self-correction—revealed something both intriguing and concerning.

Keren's eyebrows rose slightly. "Is that what they teach about Companions in Holderkin lands these days? Interesting folklore." Her tone remained neutral, neither mocking nor confrontational. "No souls will be stolen, I assure you. But if you prefer walking, I can still guide you there."

Senta snorted loudly, tossing her mane with what could only be described as indignation. The clear display of emotion—so unlike the typically serene Companion behavior—drew startled glances from the Heralds.

:Soul-stealing?: she projected to the other Companions in range, her mental voice vibrating with outrage. :Is that what they're telling their children about us now?:

:Calm yourself, Senta,: Rolan advised. :Folk beliefs take strange forms, especially in isolated communities.:

Dirk cleared his throat, hiding a smile behind his hand. "The Registry is near the Merchants' Guild Hall—about a fifteen-minute walk from here." He glanced at the position of the sun. "You might just make it if you hurry."

Skif, ever practical, added, "Take Guild Street down to the river, then follow Commerce Way east until you see the white marble building with blue flags. Can't miss it." His former street experience made him excellent at quick, clear directions.

Senta abruptly moved forward, stopping mere inches from the Holderkin youth. Her proximity forced him to either step back or find himself nearly touching her gleaming white shoulder. Her eyes—intelligent, challenging, and unmistakably aware—fixed on him with penetrating intensity.

Talia watched with growing curiosity. "Senta seems quite interested in you. That's… unusual."

"Very unusual," Dirk agreed, his voice thoughtful. "She's been unpartnered longer than most Companions her age."

Keren studied the tableau with professional interest. "I can still show you to the Registry if you wish. Or…" She glanced meaningfully at Senta. "Perhaps there's another conversation that needs to happen first."

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the Collegium grounds as this strange tableau held—Heralds watching with growing speculation, a Holderkin youth caught between ingrained superstition and practical need, and a Companion whose unusual behavior raised questions none of them could yet answer.

"The choice is yours," Talia said quietly. "But whatever beliefs you hold about Companions, I assure you they are intelligent, compassionate beings who serve Valdemar with honor. No one has ever had their soul stolen—though many of us have had our lives transformed."

Senta remained perfectly still, her challenging gaze never wavering.

:What exactly are you doing?: Rolan questioned privately.

:I'm not entirely certain,: Senta admitted. :Testing him, perhaps. Or testing myself.:

:This is highly irregular, Sister. If you intend to Choose—:

:I haven't decided,: she interrupted. :But there's something here. Something important.:

The moment stretched, taut with unspoken potential. The Heralds exchanged glances, recognizing that something significant was unfolding before them, though none could predict what might happen next.


Adam
without so much as thanks or a parting goodbye he hurries off to Registry, eager to be away from the soulless white riders


Senta
Senta stood frozen in place as the Holderkin youth fled across the Collegium grounds, his hurried footsteps betraying his eagerness to escape. Her sapphire eyes tracked his retreat, ears flicking forward in evident confusion.

"Well, that was unexpected," Dirk said, breaking the awkward silence. "Normally people don't run away quite that dramatically."

Talia watched the fleeing figure with a thoughtful expression. "Fear is a powerful motivator. The Holderkin teach their children terrible things about the outside world—especially about Companions."

:He's heading in the wrong direction,: Rolan observed privately to Senta. :The Registry is southeast, not west.:

:Of course he is,: Senta replied, her mental voice tinged with frustration. :Too proud to take directions from 'soulless white riders.':

Keren shook her head. "Should I go after him? He'll never find the Registry on that path."

"Let him go," Skif suggested, his street-wise instincts taking over. "Sometimes people need to get thoroughly lost before they're willing to accept help."

Senta abruptly tossed her mane and started walking, following the same path the young man had taken, though at a more measured pace. Her decision drew curious glances from the gathered Heralds.

"Senta?" Talia called after her.

The Companion paused, looking back over her shoulder with an expression that somehow conveyed both determination and uncertainty.

"What's she doing?" Dirk murmured to Rolan's Chosen.

Talia shrugged slightly. "I'm not sure. But Rolan seems concerned."

Indeed, the Grove-born Companion had moved to intercept Senta, positioning himself directly in her path. The two white beings stood face to face in silent communication, visible only as a subtle shifting of ears and the occasional tail flick.

:You're making a mistake,: Rolan cautioned. :This boy clearly holds views antithetical to everything we stand for.:

:Perhaps,: Senta acknowledged. :Or perhaps those views are simply what he's been taught—just as Talia was taught before her Choosing.:

:Talia questioned her teachings. This boy embraces his.:

:Does he? He's here alone, seeking legal means to challenge Holderkin traditions. There's contradiction there—potential for growth.:

Rolan's tail swished in evident frustration. :You've remained unpartnered for years because no potential Herald met your standards. Now you fixate on someone who openly despises everything we represent?:

:I haven't said I'm Choosing him,: Senta countered sharply. :I'm… investigating a possibility.:

Their silent exchange continued for several moments while the Heralds watched with growing curiosity. Finally, Rolan stepped aside with reluctant acquiescence.

:Be careful, Choosy One.: The nickname, often used teasingly by the other Companions, carried a different weight coming from the Grove-born. :Not everyone can be saved.:

Senta brushed past him without further comment, her pace quickening as she followed the Holderkin youth's trail.

"Should we be concerned?" Dirk asked quietly.

Talia watched Senta's retreating form with a thoughtful expression. "I'm not sure. But Companions have their own wisdom."

"And their own stubborn streaks," Keren added wryly. "Especially that one."

The sun continued its descent toward the horizon as Senta tracked the young man through the winding paths of the Palace complex. He had indeed taken a wrong turn, heading away from Haven's center toward the extensive gardens that bordered the royal grounds.

She maintained her distance, moving quietly enough that he remained unaware of her presence. The youth's frustration became increasingly evident in his quickening pace and the occasional muttered oath that reached her sensitive ears.

When he finally emerged onto a wider avenue near the Palace's western gate, his expression had transformed from proud defiance to poorly concealed uncertainty. The grand thoroughfare—built to impress visitors with Valdemar's prosperity—offered no helpful signs pointing toward the Registry Office.

Senta watched from the shadow of a decorative archway, her mind racing with conflicting thoughts. The sun now hung low on the horizon. The Registry would close soon, leaving the boy's quest unfulfilled.

:Why am I doing this?: she questioned herself. :Why does this one matter?:

The answer remained elusive, yet something continued to draw her toward this contradictory youth—stubborn enough to reject offered help, yet adaptable enough to seek legal solutions rather than clinging blindly to tradition.

With a decisive snort, she emerged from her hiding place, moving deliberately into his line of sight several yards ahead. The last rays of sunlight caught her white coat, making it glow with almost supernatural radiance against the deepening shadows.

The question wasn't whether he would run again. The question was whether, just maybe, he might recognize that sometimes help comes in unexpected forms—even those you've been taught to fear.

Senta
Senta's ears flicked forward in surprise. Most people confronted by a Companion either reacted with awe or scrambled to determine if they were about to be Chosen. This defiant invocation of scripture was… novel.

She remained perfectly still, her sapphire eyes studying the youth with undisguised interest. The shadows lengthened around them as the sun continued its descent, painting the western sky in brilliant oranges and purples.

:He quotes scripture at me,: she mindspoke to herself, a habit she'd developed during her lengthy unpartnered years. :As though I'm some demon from their holy texts. Fascinating.:

After a moment's consideration, she deliberately lowered her head and took three measured steps forward, reducing the distance between them. Her movements were slow, non-threatening, yet purposeful—like those of someone attempting to approach a frightened animal.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

A palace guard walking his evening rounds paused at the unusual sight—a Companion and a dusty country youth locked in what appeared to be a standoff. He watched for a moment, then continued on his way. Companions had their own business, and wise guards didn't interfere.

Senta took another careful step forward. The Registry Office would be closing soon, if it hadn't already. The youth's mission—whatever its precise nature—would remain unfulfilled until tomorrow. And if he continued rejecting help, he'd likely spend a cold night wandering Haven's streets.

She snorted softly, tossing her mane in what might almost be interpreted as exasperation. Then, with deliberate clarity, she turned her head to look over her shoulder toward the eastern gate, then back at the boy. The gesture was unmistakable—you're going the wrong way.

From a distant corner of the palace grounds, another Companion watched this strange interaction with keen interest. Kantor, bonded to the Weaponsmaster Alberich, had always appreciated Senta's independent streak. Her prolonged unpartnered status wasn't due to pickiness, as the others teased—it was discernment.

:Still playing with your Holderkin project, Choosy One?: he projected, his mental tone warm with affection despite the nickname.

:He quoted scripture at me,: she replied, a note of indignation coloring her response. :Like I'm some unholy apparition.:

:And yet you persist. Interesting.:

Senta ignored this observation, returning her full attention to the youth. Once again, she looked meaningfully toward the eastern gate, then back at him. A second time. A third.

Finally, with a soft whicker of frustration, she stepped fully to the side of the path and inclined her head in the correct direction. The message couldn't be clearer—go that way.

Evening's first stars had begun to appear overhead. Palace servants moved along the pathways lighting the ornate lanterns that illuminated the royal grounds at night. Soon the gates would close to visitors, leaving the boy stranded in unfamiliar territory.

Senta pawed at the ground impatiently. Whether he accepted her guidance or not, she'd made her offer—an unprecedented gesture from a Companion to someone who had explicitly rejected their kind.

:He's a puzzle,: she admitted to Kantor, who remained her silent witness. :Seeking to challenge tradition through legal means, yet clinging to the very beliefs that limit him.:

:Humans contain multitudes of contradictions,: Kantor observed philosophically. :It's what makes them interesting.:

:And infuriating.:

:That too.: A pause. :The Registry will be closed by now.:

:I know.: Senta's mental voice carried an uncharacteristic note of uncertainty. :What am I doing, Kantor? Why does this one matter?:

The older Companion didn't immediately respond. When he did, his mindvoice was gentle. :Some things can't be explained, only experienced. Trust your instincts, Sister.:

Senta remained motionless, her white form illuminated by the newly lit lanterns, creating a ghostly silhouette against the deepening twilight. Her offer of guidance remained extended—silent, patient, and utterly contrary to everything the Holderkin youth believed about her kind.


Adam
he slowly raises an eyebrow
"The fruit of the poisonous tree? though directions are probably safe enough."
he hurries in the direction of the Registry, finding it closed
"Well, fuck."
Senta approaches him
"Hello again spirit horse. It seems I have some time to kill, want to give some advice?" he starts into a low chuckle "Though since your responses are limited to nay, it may be quite limited"


Senta
Senta's ears perked forward at the unexpected attempt at humor. Crude as it was, the joke suggested something beyond mere fear or hostility—a capacity for adaptation, perhaps. The closed Registry Office loomed behind him, its marble facade now shadowed in twilight, blue flags limp in the evening stillness.

She approached with deliberate steps, her hooves making almost no sound on the cobblestones. The gathering darkness softened her brilliant white coat to a pearlescent glow under Haven's first evening lamps.

So he acknowledges me directly now, she thought. Progress, of a sort.

The young man's stance remained guarded, but the panic that had driven him to flee the Collegium grounds had subsided into wary curiosity. Senta found this shift intriguing—most who feared Companions as "soul-stealers" wouldn't willingly engage one in conversation, mock though it might be.

She stopped a respectful distance away, studying him with unabashed interest. Her sapphire eyes reflected the lamplight, giving them an almost ethereal quality in the growing darkness. After a moment's consideration, she deliberately inclined her head toward a public fountain nearby, then looked back at him expectantly.

The fountain featured carved stone benches arranged in a semicircle—a place where one might rest while contemplating next steps. The message seemed clear: Let's sit while you figure out what to do next.

Evening had fully descended on Haven now. The streets near the Registry Office were largely deserted as merchants and clerks retreated to homes or taverns. A few dedicated lamp-lighters moved methodically along the thoroughfare, illuminating the city's main avenues.

Senta's tail swished gently as she awaited his response. Her patience—unusual even among Companions—had earned her the reputation as the "Choosy One" among her kind. That same quality now kept her standing quietly as the Holderkin youth weighed his options in a city growing increasingly dark and unfamiliar.

With another subtle gesture toward the fountain, she took a single step in that direction, then paused, looking back at him with an expression that somehow managed to convey both invitation and challenge.

The evening breeze carried the mixed scents of Haven—baking bread from late-working bakeries, smoke from countless chimneys, and the indefinable musk of thousands of humans living in close proximity. For a country youth accustomed to open spaces and clean air, the sensory experience alone must be overwhelming.

Senta nickered softly—a gentle sound devoid of threat or mockery. The night would be long for a stranger with nowhere to go, and although she couldn't speak aloud, she could offer silent companionship while he sorted through his limited options.


Adam
he moves to take a seat
"Well no remaining family. No home or belongings, all taken by greed wrapped in tradition. Even if I can find some Valdemaran law to contest the will, I would likely have to leave the Holding afterwards and try find another. And as a newcomer even with enough wealth for some land and such, I would still be low in priority for being assigned wives, and father's claims wouldn't be enough to purchase any."


Senta
Senta moved to the fountain with graceful steps, positioning herself near enough to hear but maintaining a respectful distance. The boy's candid assessment of his situation struck her as remarkably pragmatic for someone his age. His words revealed layers of complexity beyond the religious dogma he'd initially presented.

She settled into a comfortable stance, one hoof slightly forward, head tilted attentively. The sapphire eyes that Holderkin teachings painted as soul-stealing instead reflected genuine interest in his predicament.

The fountain bubbled softly behind them, providing a gentle counterpoint to the distant sounds of Haven's evening activities. Tavern music drifted faintly from several streets away, along with occasional bursts of laughter.

:A fascinating puzzle,: she mindspoke to herself. :He speaks of wives as property to be purchased, yet shows genuine distress at losing his homestead to tradition. Contradiction upon contradiction.:

Night had fully claimed Haven now. The streets near the Registry grew increasingly deserted as shops closed and workers returned home. Only the occasional patrolling guard or late-returning merchant passed by, most paying little attention to the country youth conversing with a Companion.

Senta shifted her weight, deliberately pawing at the ground twice before looking pointedly toward a nearby street that led deeper into Haven. The gesture seemed to ask: What will you do now? Where will you go?

A cool breeze swept down the avenue, carrying the promise of autumn. Summer was fading quickly, and the night air held a distinct chill—not yet freezing, but uncomfortable for someone without lodging.

The Companion nickered softly, her ears flicking forward as though encouraging him to continue speaking. Something about this boy's situation had captured her interest beyond all reasonable explanation. Perhaps it was the echo of Talia's past—another Holderkin seeking escape from traditions that constrained them. Or perhaps it was something else entirely, some quality visible only to Companion intuition.

She looked deliberately toward the city center, then back at him, head tilted in obvious inquiry. The unspoken question hung between them: Do you have somewhere to stay tonight?

The stone bench must have been growing cold beneath him as evening deepened toward night. Guards would soon begin encouraging loiterers to move along, particularly near government buildings like the Registry. A Holderkin youth with limited funds would find his options narrowing with each passing hour.

Senta's tail swished thoughtfully as she considered his predicament. Despite his offensive comments and clear distrust of her kind, she found herself oddly invested in his welfare. It was most unusual—and yet, something continued to draw her to this contradictory young man.


Adam
"The Holding Elders would most certainly cast me out even for questioning their rights of taking everything that is mine by blood. I suppose when you come at the king, you had best not miss. And they will use scripture to justify the theft" he starts into a low chuckle "And thus I clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stolen out of holy writ; And seem a saint, when most I play the devil."
a pause, far too long of a pause
"You're a good listener, horse. Thanks, I think."


Senta
Senta's ears pricked forward at the unexpected quotation—certainly not scripture, but something literary with surprising depth. For a supposedly backward Holderkin youth, his words carried unusual eloquence. The contradiction fascinated her all the more.

The genuine thanks that followed—reluctant though it might be—marked the first crack in his hostile facade. Senta acknowledged it with a gentle dip of her head, sapphire eyes reflecting the nearby lantern light.

A night patrol of two Guards rounded the corner, their uniforms crisp despite the late hour. They paused briefly at the sight of a Companion, offering respectful nods before continuing their rounds. Their presence served as a reminder that lingering near government buildings after dark often attracted official attention.

Senta shifted her weight deliberately, glancing toward a street that led deeper into Haven's Lower City. With careful movements, she approached the fountain's edge, extending her neck to take a drink from the clear water. After slaking her thirst, she looked pointedly at the youth, then toward the water—a clear invitation for him to refresh himself before deciding his next move.

The night had grown properly cold now. Mist formed around Senta's nostrils with each exhaled breath, visible in the lamplight. Few people remained on the streets in this district, most having retreated to warm hearths or lively taverns. For a stranger with limited funds, Haven after dark presented both opportunity and danger.

After a moment's consideration, Senta deliberately moved a few paces in the direction of the Lower City, then stopped to look back at him. She repeated the motion, her intention unmistakable—follow me.

Whether he would interpret this as friendly guidance or confirm his suspicions of Companions leading humans astray remained to be seen. Yet something about this contradictory young man—quoting scripture one moment and sophisticated literature the next—continued to intrigue her beyond all reasonable explanation.


Adam
"Well you listened to me venting. Lead on then, horse."


Senta
Senta moved with purpose through Haven's darkening streets, her white coat gleaming under the sporadic lamplight. She maintained a deliberate pace, glancing back occasionally to ensure the Holderkin youth followed. The winding path she chose avoided the busier thoroughfares, instead tracing quieter avenues where her presence would draw less attention.

:I must be losing my mind,: she projected to no one in particular. :Leading a Holderkin boy who thinks I'm a demon straight back to the Collegium.:

Yet something about his reluctant trust—following a creature he'd been taught to fear—stirred an unfamiliar warmth within her. The "Choosy One" had remained unpartnered far longer than most Companions her age, earning gentle teasing from her peers. Her standards had always seemed impossibly high… until now.

The night air grew increasingly chill as they traveled, mist forming with each exhaled breath. Haven's evening sounds surrounded them—distant music from taverns, the occasional burst of laughter, the rhythmic footfalls of night patrols.

As they approached the Palace district, the Guard presence intensified. A pair of sentries at a checkpoint straightened at Senta's approach, then relaxed upon recognizing a Companion. Their curious glances at her human companion went unvoiced—Companions had their own business, and wise guards didn't interfere.

:Letting him through without question,: she observed. :They assume he's with me in some official capacity.:

The grand avenues surrounding the Palace complex gradually gave way to the manicured paths of the Collegium grounds. Night had fully claimed Haven now, but the Collegium remained awake—windows glowed with warm light, and the occasional group of Herald-trainees crossed between buildings, their gray uniforms visible in the darkness.

Senta paused at the edge of a small courtyard surrounded by modest dormitory buildings. A fountain bubbled at its center, the sound creating a peaceful atmosphere despite the lateness of the hour. She turned to face her unlikely companion, her sapphire eyes catching the lamplight.

Now what? she wondered. The young man had followed her—a remarkable act of trust given his professed beliefs. But bringing a Holderkin youth with apparent anti-Companion sentiments into the heart of Herald training raised questions she hadn't fully considered.

From across the courtyard, another Companion emerged from the shadows. Kantor approached with measured steps, his powerful form moving with surprising delicacy.

:Bold move, Choosy One,: he projected, his mental tone tinged with wry amusement. :Bringing him here.:

:He needed somewhere to go,: Senta replied defensively. :The Registry was closed.:

:And naturally, you brought him to the very place he fled from earlier. Logical.:

:He followed willingly enough.:

Kantor circled around them, his intelligent eyes studying the Holderkin youth with undisguised curiosity. :Alberich would find this interesting. A potential enemy within our gates… or perhaps something else entirely.:

Senta flicked her tail in annoyance. :He's a boy with nowhere to go, not an enemy spy.:

:So defensive,: Kantor observed. :One might almost think…:

:Don't say it.:

:…that you're considering—:


Adam

Senta
:—Choosing him,: Kantor finished, his mindvoice carrying a hint of mischief.

Senta's ears flattened against her head in pure indignation. The very suggestion struck a nerve so raw she momentarily forgot their Holderkin guest. Her tail lashed sharply, hooves shifting on the cobblestones with barely contained emotion.

:I am not—: She cut herself off, aware that her vehemence only encouraged Kantor's suspicions. :He's a curiosity, nothing more.:

:A curiosity you've followed for days. A curiosity you protected from thugs in Exile's Gate. A curiosity you've now led to the heart of the Collegium despite his rather colorful opinions about our kind.: Kantor's mental tone dripped with skepticism.

Senta snorted loudly, tossing her mane in frustration. The gesture drew a startled look from the Holderkin youth, who clearly couldn't hear the silent exchange but could certainly observe its visible effects.

:He quoted literature—actual literature, not just scripture. There's a mind beneath all that conditioning,: she insisted. :And he's homeless, facing a difficult situation. Showing basic compassion hardly means I'm planning to Choose him.:

:If you say so, Choosy One.:

The nickname—long a source of mild irritation when used by her peers—sparked genuine annoyance when applied to this situation. Senta deliberately turned her back on Kantor, focusing her attention on the Holderkin youth who had followed her into what his people would consider the den of soul-stealing demons.

The night had grown properly cold now. The fountain's gentle splashing created a peaceful backdrop to the muted sounds of evening activities in the surrounding buildings. Lights shone from dormitory windows, and occasional laughter drifted from the Herald-trainees' quarters.

Senta moved toward a covered arcade that bordered the courtyard, offering shelter from the night air. She looked pointedly at the stone bench beneath it, then back at the youth. The message seemed clear: You can rest here tonight.

It wasn't proper protocol—civilian visitors weren't supposed to spend nights unattended on Collegium grounds. But she had brought him here, and now felt responsible for his welfare. Something about his plight, his contradictions, and his unexpected willingness to follow her despite his professed beliefs continued to intrigue her beyond all reasonable explanation.

She pawed at the ground impatiently, ears still flattened from her silent argument with Kantor. The "Choosy One" indeed—as though selectivity were somehow shameful when it came to the most important decision a Companion could make.

:I'll fetch someone to properly assist him,: Kantor offered, his mental tone softening.

:No,: Senta replied firmly. :I brought him here. I'll handle this.:

:As you wish.:

Kantor retreated with a final knowing look that sent another wave of indignation through Senta. She refocused on the young man, gesturing again toward the bench with a deliberate nod.

The stone seat wasn't ideal, but it offered shelter from potential rain and remained warmer than sleeping on open ground. Tomorrow would bring new challenges—explaining his presence to the Collegium staff, helping him navigate his legal inquiries—but for tonight, at least, he wouldn't freeze in Haven's unfamiliar streets.

Senta settled into a comfortable stance nearby, making it clear she intended to remain. Her sapphire eyes—the very ones Holderkin teachings claimed would steal souls—reflected both determination and uncertainty as she watched this contradictory youth whom she most definitely was not considering as her Chosen.

Definitely not.

Almost certainly not.

Probably.
