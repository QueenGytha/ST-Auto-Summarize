    "extracted": [
      "Kordas cancelled the planned welcome feast to preserve stores for winter, stating provisions should be traded for tools, weapons, or labor rather than consumed in ceremony. Staff noted this as practically minded, contrasting with the previous Baron who prioritized ceremony regardless of cost.",
      "Kordas requested honest reports on estate conditions with 'no sanitization or hiding problems,' establishing a precedent of complete transparency he expects maintained.",
      "Kordas instructed staff to call him 'Kordas' rather than formal titles, though most struggle with the informality. Meadow Sage finds the name 'too familiar' but honors the request.",
      "Commander Vesper (Night Watch): 'The night brings things from the Everfree that daylight ponies prefer not to see.' Cryptic warning establishing her role as bearer of uncomfortable truths about nocturnal threats.",
      "Captain Bulwark on defenses: 'Manor's defensible, but we're undermanned. The walls will hold against timberwolves and the occasional cockatrice, but anything serious... We'd need to pull the village inside and hope reinforcements arrive from Thornford or Stormridge lands.' Added: 'Hope is not a strategy' acknowledged by Kordas.",
      "Political situation: Count Thornford (south) is 'a bastard' who considers Kordas 'barely a step above a jumped-up sergeant' due to military nobility vs old money. Will trade out of necessity but won't provide aid without royal command. Baroness Stormridge (north) is reliable, fellow military veteran, three-hour flight response time but dealing with griffon raiders. Duke Meadowvale (regional overlord, four days south) views frontier holdings as 'expendable buffer territories' and denied two garrison reinforcement requests.",
      "Everfree threats escalating: Timberwolves hunt in packs, cockatrices wander when hungry, two manticore sightings in past year (usually stay deep in forest). Vesper: 'Something's been stirring them up lately.'",
      "Merchant caravan incident two months ago: Found three miles from forest edge, completely empty, no blood or bodies, just overturned wagons and scattered goods. Draft horses gone, everything else untouched. This caused merchants to avoid the western road through Willowmere, taking longer route through Thornford instead, costing Willowmere tax revenue.",
      "Vesper: 'There are... movements in the Everfree. Coordinated. Not mindless beasts. Something with intelligence directs them.' Two pairs of Night Watch scouts sent into forest perimeter never returned.",
      "Military strength: 12 guards (4 veterans from Griffon campaigns or bandit raids, 8 locally trained recruits), 4 Night Watch (all experienced, former Princess Luna's guard), 40 militia (farmers with pitchforks, largely useless against organized threats). Bulwark: 'Against anything organized? We'd need three times the garrison and proper fortifications.'",
      "Treasury: 150 bits total. Meadow Sage: 'We would need to choose. Security or surplus. We cannot afford both before winter.' Previous Baron spent heavily on emergency grain purchases after early frost damaged last autumn's harvest.",
      "Weather team: 6 pegasi including Zephyr Gale (should be 10 for territory size). Lost one member last year to transfer to Cloudsdale for better pay, couldn't afford replacement. Count Thornwood has weather team twice their size and could loan ponies 'for a price.'",
      "Kordas immediately repurposed his two idle riding horses for field work, establishing precedent of eliminating waste. Dusty Saddle will put them to work in fields, easing strain on plow teams.",
      "Total population: 340 ponies. Breakdown: 280 earth ponies, 40 pegasi, 20 unicorns. 12 professional guards, 4 night watch, 28 manor/administrative staff, ~296 village residents (180 agricultural workers, 40 dependent children, 30 essential services, 46 elderly/infirm).",
      "Population crisis: Median age 38, few ponies aged 20-30 (leaving for opportunities elsewhere), declining population over past 5 years. Meadow Sage: 'In ten years, if the trend continues, we'll face a crisis as our older workers age out of heavy labor.'",
      "Everfree incursion rate increasing: 17 documented incursions within 5 miles in past month (timberwolves, three cockatrice sightings, one unidentified creature). Last year same time: 9 incursions for entire month. Vesper: 'Something is changing. The forest grows bolder. We may not have seven months before crisis comes.'",
      "Why youth leave - testimonials: Hearthglow's granddaughter went to Thornford merchant house for twice the pay, proper dormitory, and freedom from constant Everfree fear. Zephyr's brother joined Fillydelphia weather team, tired of frontier conditions and no advancement. Bulwark's nephew joined Royal Guard Academy, called Willowmere 'a dying backwater.' Quillwrite admits he's considered leaving for Canterlot archives (better pay, libraries, advancement) but stays from obligation, not opportunity.",
      "What Willowmere offers elsewhere: 'More gold, more safety, more chance for advancement, more access to education and culture. Towns like Thornford have theaters, libraries, guilds for specialized trades. They have stone walls and professional garrisons. They have markets where merchants come from across Equestria. They have futures.'",
      "Copper Pot: 'The ones who leave aren't the lazy ones or the cowards. That's what hurts. They're the ambitious, the clever, the strong. The ones who could make Willowmere better if they stayed.'",
      "Hearthglow: 'You want to stop the bleeding, m'lord? You need to give the young ones a reason to stay. Safety, opportunity, something to build toward. My granddaughter didn't leave because she hated Willowmere—she left because staying meant accepting a small, frightened life with no chance of more.'",
      "Actual advantages Willowmere can offer: Rapid merit-based advancement (small organization allows young ponies to rise fast - Zephyr is weather coordinator at 24, Meadow became steward at 26, impossible in larger establishments), potential land ownership (available land for expansion, could grant actual deeds vs renting forever in towns), meaningful visible work (contributions matter, you're seen vs anonymous in crowds), operational flexibility (can implement innovations without bureaucratic delays), direct access to nobility (Kordas sits with common staff, unprecedented), room to fill niches (become the best by being the only one), profit opportunities from Everfree proximity (alchemists/scholars pay well for specimens, dangerous but profitable).",
      "Training rotation proposal during pre-harvest window: Quillwrite suggests taking shifts of 10 militia members for intensive drilling during ~2 month window between spring planting completion and harvest labor. Could cycle through all 40 twice. Would require extra rations or small bonus for existing guards running the drills.",
      "Hearthglow's final words: 'Hope. You give these ponies hope that things can be different, that their work builds toward something better rather than just delaying collapse, and they'll surprise you with what they can accomplish. But hope requires proof. Promises won't do it—the previous Baron made plenty. Action. That's what's needed.'",
      "Kordas's military legend (public version): Said to have led flawless flanking maneuver at Gryphus Pass that shattered griffon left wing. Rallied three broken units with signal flags and courage when day seemed lost. The 'Kordas Gambit' - dove straight into griffon center with tiny force, drawing their entire reserve out of position while main army swept flanks. Taught at Canterlot military academy as 'strategic positioning and decisive action in the face of overwhelming odds.'",
      "Vesper's version (bat pony intelligence): The flanking maneuver was actually Kordas separated from his main force by griffon counterattack, trying to rejoin his unit and accidentally emerging behind enemy lines - griffons panicked thinking it was coordinated pincer. The Gambit was a retreating unit getting cut off, Kordas going in to extract them because abandoning soldiers wasn't acceptable - griffons assumed no commander would dive into center without massive support, committed reserves to counter nonexistent trap.",
      "Kordas calls Princess Celestia 'Celly' - she permits this familiarity. He told her he didn't deserve the barony but 'she wouldn't hear of it.'",
      "Kordas's true confession via song: The flanking maneuver was him screaming 'Retreat! Fall back!' but his voice cracked and it came out sounding like 'Flank and attack!' He slipped and pointed toward a hill while falling - troops thought it was intentional signal. Signal flares were a lantern exploding accidentally when he ducked behind a wagon. He climbed rubble gasping for air and troops saw it as rallying. He tumbled into a trench while yelling - they called it strategy. Everything attributed to genius was panic, accidents, and desperate survival instinct that happened to work.",
      "Staff reaction to confession: Initial shock, then collective hysterical laughter. Bulwark: 'The military academy teaches courses on your tactics! There are dissertations! Scholarly analysis of your tripping!' General consensus: honest disaster is better than dishonest competence, they now trust him more because he gave them truth instead of maintaining a legend.",
      "Vesper: 'Luck favors the desperate. And we are, all of us in this room, very desperate indeed. You survived impossible odds through chaos and quick thinking. We face impossible odds. Perhaps chaos and quick thinking is exactly what Willowmere needs.'",
      "Bulwark: 'Traditional strategy hasn't saved this estate. Careful planning, measured responses—the previous Baron did all that. We're still dying. Maybe what we need is a pony who doesn't know what he's doing but does it anyway.'",
      "Vesper: 'Honesty is rare among nobility. Rarer still among commanders. You could have maintained the legend. Instead you gave us truth. The Night Watch values truth. We will follow honest chaos over dishonest order.'",
      "Relationship dynamics established: Staff went from cautious deference to genuine investment. Kordas established himself as radically transparent, self-deprecating, practical over ceremonial, and willing to abandon noble pretense. Staff responded with matching honesty and tentative hope rather than fear or formal distance.",
      "Meadow Sage's assessment: 'Our Baron is a lucky disaster who survived war through panic and accident, who calls Princess Celestia by a nickname, and who just sang us a confession disguised as comedy.' She's moved from professional wariness to cautious optimism mixed with exasperated affection.",
      "Official record decision: Details of confession not to be recorded. Meadow Sage wrote: 'Baron Kordas addressed assembled staff, establishing protocols of transparency and candor. Morale significantly improved.'"
