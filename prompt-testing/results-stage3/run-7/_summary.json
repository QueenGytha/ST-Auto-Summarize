  "final_recap": "DEV: Lisle village obliterated—Rance's latent Mage-Gift awakened during bandit attack, unleashing catastrophic magical fury; Senta Chose Rance during crisis, stabilizing burned-open channels. Attackers identified as Karsite special forces disguised as bandits; red Sun-Priest robes recovered from bodies; took live captives for blood magic/human sacrifice. Four-day ride to Haven; Healers stabilized Rance. Addressed Queen's Circle—revealed complete mind-merge with Talia during Mind-Healing memory recovery; now shares all memories, state secrets, training, protocol knowledge. Circle sealed information; arranged Healer's cottage in Companion's Field for isolation/safety. Herald Myste dispatched to archives for Mage-Gift training records (first Mage-Gift since Vanyel, centuries ago). Kyril tasked with contacting Rethwellan/Hardorn/Menmellith regarding Karsite activity. Official cover: ordinary Herald-trainee. Rance and Senta settled into isolated cottage. Talia arrived at dawn with decision about shared-memory situation; public pretense of formal distance between Rance-Talia begins. Rance and Talia consummated relationship—Talia's first sexual experience. Rance used untrained Mage-Gift telekinetically (slammed door, closed curtains)—raw channels caused pain, demonstrated unpredictable power during emotional intensity.\n\nPEND: How to present formalized Rance-Talia connection to Selenay—semi-official arrangement known to Circle but hidden publicly. Training regimen for unprecedented Mage-Gift without living teachers. Alberich's training approach. Karsite blood magic campaign scope—Valdemar-specific or broader threat? Fate of captured villagers. Contingency if Rance loses control. Circle's private deliberations on security/political ramifications.",
