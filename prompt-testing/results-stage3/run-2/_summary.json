  "final_recap": "DEV: Lisle destroyed; Rance's Mage-Gift (first since Vanyel) awakened catastrophically during Karsite raid, obliterated village. Karsites (special forces disguised as bandits) captured villagers for blood magic/demon summoning. Senta Chose Rance; bond stabilized wild Gift. Arrived Haven; delivered report to Circle. Complete mind-merge with Talia during memory recovery—Rance possesses all her memories/knowledge/training as Queen's Own; she has his trauma. Circle ordered: archives search for Mage-Gift training, discreet diplomatic inquiries to Karse's neighbors, Rance quartered at remote Healer's cottage, information sealed to Circle only. Official cover: ordinary trainee. Rance and Senta settled into isolated cottage at Haven's edge. Rance and Talia consummated their connection at cottage; her first sexual experience, explicitly claimed.\n\nPEND: Talia meeting Selenay in under two candlemarks; must present as composed Queen's Own while bearing physical evidence of encounter; partnership proposal now carries unspoken personal dimension. Talia's full recovery uncertain. Court power structure threatened by two people holding Queen's Own knowledge. No living teachers for Mage-Gift. Uncontrolled Gift poses assassination risk to Valdemaran leadership. Karsite blood magic organization's intent unknown. Alberich's potential training approach uncertain.",
