Circle ordered: archives search for Mage-Gift training, discreet diplomatic inquiries to Karse's neighbors, Rance quartered at remote Healer's cottage, information sealed to Circle only; official cover ordinary trainee. Rance and Senta settled into isolated cottage at Haven's edge. Talia resolved to propose major plan to Selenay regarding shared memories situation; seeking Rance's input first.

No living teachers for Mage-Gift; uncontrolled Gift poses assassination risk to Valdemaran leadership. Karsite blood magic intent unknown; organization may return. Talia meeting Selenay within two candlemarks to present mind-merge plan; must appear composed Queen's Own while bearing physical evidence of intimacy; partnership proposal now carries unspoken personal dimension."
