  "final_recap": "DEV: Village of Lisle destroyed—Rance's Mage-Gift awakened catastrophically during Karsite raid disguised as banditry; obliterated village. Karsites in red robes (hidden under bandit clothing) captured villagers for suspected blood magic/demon summoning; organized infiltration, footprints to Menmellith border. Senta Chose Rance; bond stabilized wild Gift. Senta carried unconscious Rance to Haven over 4 days. Complete mind-merge with Talia during memory recovery—Rance now possesses all her memories/knowledge/training as Queen's Own; Talia has his trauma. Circle ordered: archives search for Mage-Gift training, discreet diplomatic inquiries to Karse's neighbors, Rance quartered at remote Healer's cottage, information sealed to Circle only; official cover ordinary trainee. Rance and Senta settled into isolated cottage at Haven's edge. Talia resolved to propose major plan to Selenay regarding shared memories situation; seeking Rance's input first. Rance and Talia consummated connection at cottage—her first sexual experience; explicitly claimed by him.\n\nPEND: Court power structure threatened by two people holding Queen's Own knowledge. No living teachers for Mage-Gift; uncontrolled Gift poses assassination risk to Valdemaran leadership. Karsite blood magic intent unknown; organization may return. Talia meeting Selenay within two candlemarks to present mind-merge plan; must appear composed Queen's Own while bearing physical evidence of intimacy; partnership proposal now carries unspoken personal dimension.",
