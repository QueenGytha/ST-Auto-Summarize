    "content": "Village headman of Lisle, age 40; skilled rider with possible military background. Suffered severe Gift-shock from latent Mage-Gift forcibly awakening—channels burned open by raw uncontrolled power during defense of village; vision blurry, mental agony from newly opened magical channels he cannot understand or control; believes external force destroyed Lisle, unaware he caused it. Channels remain damaged, needs Healing at Haven.\n\nGift-shock coma for 4 days during transit; stabilized by herbs but channels remain fragile. Committed to contingency: demands knockout if he loses control to prevent harming leadership. Currently unconscious in Healers' Collegium.\n\nMage-Gift confirmed to Circle—first Herald-Mage since Vanyel era. Assigned remote quarters (healer's cottage, Companion's Field) for containment safety. Status: Herald-trainee officially; true capabilities sealed to Circle only. Possesses complete memory/knowledge merge with Talia—her entire life, training, state secrets, shielding techniques.",

    "content": "Adult Companion mare, brilliant white coat, silver hooves, sapphire eyes; unpartnered for 3 years until now. STANCE-Rance: Chose him as her Herald despite his age and circumstances; bond formed—loves him unconditionally, protective, exasperated by his stubbornness, determined to keep him alive and get him proper training; knows he caused Lisle's destruction though he doesn't yet understand; recognizes red robes as organized threat beyond common banditry. Can sense magic; travel endurance far exceeds normal horses.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: bond deepening—protective, affectionate ('you are mine as you are mine'); impressed by his strategic thinking and caution regarding regicide risk; refuses separation even after exhaustion from 4-day forced march. IDENTITY: Record-speed journey to Haven (4 days); supernatural endurance demonstrated. Speculation confirmed to self: Rance's Gift likely unprecedented, untrainable—worse than Firestarting, not seen in 5 centuries.\n\nWitnessed/felt mind-merge through bond—experienced psychic backlash. Understands implications of Mage-Gift return. RELATIONSHIP-Rolan: coordinated through Companion network during crisis.\n\nFully recovered after grooming and rest—energy and alertness restored. Detected Talia's emotional state shift from night before—noted increased control and certainty replacing earlier vulnerability.\n\nWitnessed through bond the sexual encounter between Rance and Talia despite attempting distance; positioned as guard outside cottage during their coupling; experienced complex emotions about timing and complications. STANCE-Rance: Concerned about him using untrained Mage-Gift telekinetically (slamming door, closing curtains); cautioned him about dangers of raw channels; couldn't fully shield from intensity of their connection during sex.",

Currently with Healer Crescent, recovering from mental fusion. RELATIONSHIP-Circle: recovery status uncertain; capability as Queen's Own questioned.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Consulted him privately before presenting decision to Selenay—treating him as peer advisor rather than subordinate Trainee despite rank difference. Overnight resolved internal conflict into new determination; reached significant decision about managing shared-memory situation affecting both of them. Experiencing disorientation from memory fragments—reaches for Rance's memories that aren't fully there, struggles with physical differences (stride length). More controlled and certain than previous evening's vulnerability.\n\nPHYSICAL: Lost virginity to Rance; marked with bruising bite on breast (hidden under Whites); body bears evidence of rough claiming. ARC: Discovered she responds intensely to dominance, degradation, and being called crude names during sex; found liberation in surrendering control; experienced powerful orgasms from submission. STANCE-Rance: Relationship transcended political partnership into physical/sexual intimacy; surrendered completely to him in ways she's never allowed anyone; trusts him with submissive/degradation-responsive parts of herself she didn't know existed. STATE: Post-sexual, disheveled, needs to clean up before meeting Selenay.",
