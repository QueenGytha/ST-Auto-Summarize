    "content": "IDENTITY: Unpartnered Companion mare for 3 years (adult status), silver hooves, sapphire eyes, silver-white mane. CHANGE: Chose Rance—bonded. STATE: Can mind-speak with Chosen; senses magic; travels 3x distance of ordinary horses. ARC: Found her Chosen in catastrophic circumstances—dealing with stubborn, grief-stricken partner who doesn't yet understand he caused destruction himself. STANCE-Rance: Chosen bond—unconditional love, exasperation at stubbornness, protective. Blocking his self-destructive impulses while guiding him toward survival/training. Firm: 'You are never alone again.' Knows he has immensely powerful Gift (type unknown), triggered by trauma.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Bond deepened through journey—moved from frustrated duty to genuine attachment. Felt his affection when he nuzzled her, recognized caring beneath his granite exterior. Now fiercely protective, refuses separation even when exhausted. Sees him as true partner ('we face it together'). STANCE-Rolan: Met briefly at Haven arrival, accepted his greeting but prioritized staying with Rance over rest.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Identified his Mage-Gift during chamber crisis. Stands beside/touches him constantly. Contingency partner—will knock him out if control lost.\n\nSTANCE-Rolan: Coordinating through Companion network during crisis.\n\nSTATE: Coat dulled from hard travel. Exhausted but vigilant.\n\nSTATE: Maintained guard outside cottage during Rance and Talia's intimacy, attempting to give privacy while unable to fully shield from their bond connection. ARC: Witnessed/sensed the unprecedented development between her Chosen and the Queen's Own. Initial embarrassment gave way to resigned acceptance of complications. STANCE-Rance: Concerned about his untrained Mage-Gift use (telekinesis with excessive force). Dry humor about complications. STANCE-Talia: Sensed her complete surrender and discovered desires even the memory-merge hadn't revealed.",

Trusts him with her vulnerabilities + role. He has all her memories/knowledge.\n\nARC: First time allowing someone to share her burdens. Walls between compartmentalized self dissolving.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Seeks his counsel before presenting decisions to Selenay—treating him as collaborative partner rather than subordinate despite rank difference. Comfortable visiting his isolated cottage alone at dawn. Shifted from vulnerable confusion to decisive action overnight regarding shared-memory situation. Uses formal Court cadence when discussing matters of weight.\n\nSTATE: No longer a virgin—hymen torn, breast bitten/marked, filled with Rance's seed. Body marked with evidence that will be hidden beneath her Whites when she meets Selenay. ARC: Discovered she responds intensely to domination, rough treatment, and degradation—finds release in surrender after years of carrying responsibility. Broke through her terror of losing herself in another person. Used crude language and Holderkin degradation vocabulary that she'd rejected for decades. Experienced two powerful orgasms. The careful control and diplomatic mask she maintained for years was thoroughly shattered.",
