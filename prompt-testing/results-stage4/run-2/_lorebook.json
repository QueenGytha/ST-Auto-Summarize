    "content": "Identity: 40-year-old former headman of Lisle; skilled rider with possible military background; stoic, pragmatic, stubborn to the point of self-destruction. State: Newly awakened immensely powerful Mage-Gift (unknown type, possibly Firestarting)—burned open mental channels cause white-hot agony, blurred vision, teetering sanity; Gift-shock severe; physically exhausted but forcing himself through sheer willpower. Arc: Witnessed entire village destroyed and people carried off during bandit attack; believes others caused destruction—doesn't yet fully accept he did it himself; driven by duty to warn Haven despite trauma; initially dismissed Senta as 'insufferable horse,' called her for mercy killing. Relationship with Senta: Chosen by her—bond snapped into place when their eyes locked; her unconditional love and mental bridges stabilized his fracturing mind enough to survive; accepts bond pragmatically ('I'm in no position to argue') but resists her care ('If you tire, I'll drag you'); their connection allows mind-speech though it pains his ragged channels. Evidence gathered: Red robes hidden under bandit clothing; suspects organized sect, not simple bandits; tracks lead toward Menmellith.\n\nAccepted Companion bond—shifted from resistance to partnership (affectionate nuzzle, 'we face it together'). Knows Karsite features/tactics from border proximity; theories captives meant for blood magic ritual sacrifice (old Karsite practice). Believed Herald-Mages were historical fiction, not real. Ordered Senta to knock him out if he loses control—accepts danger he poses. Gift-shock caused four-day unconsciousness during journey. Memories of Lisle destruction still blocked/suppressed. Now physically at Haven Healers' Collegium, unconscious but stable.\n\nMage-Gift officially confirmed to Circle—power capable of leveling villages, not seen since Vanyel's era. Complete mind-merge with Talia gave him all her memories, training, state secrets, intimate knowledge; can use her shielding techniques and protocol; occasionally slips into her mannerisms/authority. Untrained Mindspeech forced through Talia's shields, stabilized her mental collapse through direct contact, closed connection via kiss. Demonstrated impossible magical feats (full memory-merge should be fatal). Assigned Healer's cottage for containment. Taking on strategic leadership role using combined knowledge of headman experience and Talia's expertise. Instinctive distrust of Karsites from decades fighting border raids, but assessed Alberich's loyalty pragmatically.",

    "content": "Identity: Adult Companion mare, brilliant white coat, silver hooves, sapphire eyes, silver-white mane; unpartnered for three years before this. Arc: Drew toward devastation by the Call; found Rance collapsed in crater surrounded by wild magic residue; recognized Gift-shock and uncontrolled awakening; Chose him despite his age, bitterness, and catastrophic first manifestation—'There is only the right Chosen for each Companion.' Relationship with Rance: Chose him after he examined evidence; bond formed when eyes locked—her mindvoice 'clear as crystal bells, warm as summer sunshine'; poured unconditional love into him, stabilized his fracturing mind with mental bridges across burned channels; revealed he caused the destruction himself; frustrated by his stubbornness (insulted when he called her 'horse,' irritated when he insisted on examining bodies, nipped his shoulder to get attention); accepts his determination but insists on Waystation stop for herbs/rest; their bond already stabilizing his wild Gift; shares his purpose to warn Haven. Abilities: Mind-speech with Chosen; can travel three times distance of ordinary horses; heightened magical senses.\n\nBond with Rance solidified—reciprocal affection established. Suspects Rance's Gift is rarer/more dangerous than Firestarting; unprecedented in five centuries with no one capable of training it. Confirmed Karsite blood magic historically real, officially banned for decades—revival concerning. Promised to incapacitate Rance if he loses control. Rode relentlessly four days/nights without true rest to reach Haven. Met Rolan (Queen's Own Companion) upon arrival; refused to leave Rance's side despite exhaustion.\n\nStood guard during memory recovery, witnessed unprecedented full mind-merge. Confirmed contingency to knock Rance unconscious if he loses control. Identified his Gift as Mage-Gift—raw, wild type not seen since Vanyel. Exhausted from days of hard travel carrying unconscious Rance across Valdemar; coat dulled with road dust. Increasingly awed by scope of Rance's abilities while concerned about political/magical ramifications.",
