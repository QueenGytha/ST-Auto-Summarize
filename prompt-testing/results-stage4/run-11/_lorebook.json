    "content": "IDENTITY: Unpartnered Companion mare for 3 years until now. White coat, silver hooves, sapphire eyes. Can travel triple distance of ordinary horses. STANCE-Rance: Chose him despite his age (40) and devastated state. Bond formed—pours unconditional love into him, stabilizes his ragged channels. Frustrated by his stubbornness but recognizes steel beneath grief. Shares purpose: get evidence to Haven, train his Gift. Views him as 'right Chosen' regardless of circumstances. Protective—refuses to let him examine bodies initially, insists on Waystation rest despite his protests.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Surprised by his affection at Waystation (mane stroke, nuzzle), approved of his matching stubbornness and caring beneath gruff exterior. Monitored his Gift-shock condition constantly, refused separation even after arriving Haven. Sees him thinking like Herald already. Trust established: agreed to knock him out if he loses control near Queen. Connected to Rolan (Queen's Own Companion) who greeted her at Haven.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Deep pride in his practical leadership and contingency planning. Exasperated by his spite-driven approach to 'impossible' feats. Projects steady support through bond while concerned about political tightrope. Recognizes he thinks like both Herald and headman—why she Chose him.\n\nSTATE: Fully recovered—coat restored to gleaming silver-white, energy and alertness returned. STANCE-Rance: Absolute certainty about Choosing him despite chaos ('most right thing I've ever done'). Advised cryptically about bonds: 'Some chosen, some thrust upon us. All requiring care.'\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Concern about untrained Mage-Gift cottage damage—'leveling cottage would require extensive paperwork.' STANCE-Talia: Surprised by her submissive response—understanding of her need for surrender after years of responsibility. STATE: Unable to fully shield from bond during intimacy despite withdrawal attempt; positioned outside cottage as sentry.",

Now seeks Rance's input before presenting plan to Selenay—treating him as collaborator rather than problem.\n\nPHYSICAL: Lost virginity to Rance—bite mark evidence.
