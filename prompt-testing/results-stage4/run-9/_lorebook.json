Carries red robe hood wrapped around bandit blade as evidence. Headed to Haven to report threat.\n\nGift-shock induced unconsciousness for four days.

Recognizes his Gift as exceptionally powerful but unknown type. Determined to get him to Haven alive for training.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: refused separation even after reaching Haven. Suspects Rance's Gift is unprecedented—rarer than Firestarting, unseen for five centuries, with no available trainers. Confirmed Karsite blood magic stories are historical fact, not myth.\n\nCoat dulled from days of hard travel—road dust and sweat. Exhausted but standing guard. Witnessed unprecedented mind-merge between Chosen and Talia; realized Rance possesses raw Mage-Gift not seen since Vanyel's time. Protective and concerned about implications. STANCE-Rance: Chose him knowing complications would arise but rewriting magical theory wasn't expected; steady support through crisis; gentle reproach about untrained Mindspeech rudeness; pride mixed with exasperation at his spite-driven impossibilities; projected assessment that his village leadership and contingency planning reflect why he was Chosen.\n\nFully recovered—coat gleaming, energy restored. Alert and cautious about Talia's changed demeanor.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Concerned about his untrained Mage-Gift manifestation (door slam). Witnessed entire coupling through bond despite attempting distance—cannot fully shield from connection.

He helped her work through buried trauma during merge. Now recovering with Healer Crescent, overwhelmed but in better emotional state than before. Shared passionate kiss as he closed mental connection. Complex emotions toward him: violation/understanding, fear/gratitude, professional concern/personal fascination.\n\nMade significant decision overnight about handling shared-memory situation; emotional state shifted from vulnerable to resolved and controlled; fragments of Rance's memories remain but fading. Seeks Rance's input before presenting plan to Selenay—decision 'concerns both of us' and 'potentially changes everything.' More formal, determined bearing.\n\nIDENTITY: No longer virgin—physically marked (bite bruise on breast). Discovered intense responsiveness to dominance/degradation—specifically when Holderkin heritage invoked; finds release in surrendering control after years carrying Kingdom's burdens. STANCE-Rance: Sexually bonded; responds to his dominance with abandon; allows him to see/command vulnerability she's never shown anyone; their connection now explicitly romantic/sexual layered over political partnership and mind-merge.
