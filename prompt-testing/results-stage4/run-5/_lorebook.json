STANCE-Rance: Chose him despite his age/bitterness; unconditional love through bond; frustrated by his stubbornness but committed; recognizes steel core beneath his guilt. Knows he caused Lisle's destruction via awakened Gift; using bond to partially stabilize his burned channels. Determined to get him to Haven alive for training and testimony.\n\nSTANCE-Rolan: acknowledged his authority/support but refused to leave Rance's side. STATE: exhausted after days of relentless travel; refused rest to stay with Chosen. Suspects Rance's Gift is rarer/more dangerous than Firestarting—unprecedented power unseen 500 years, no one capable of training it. Confirmed Karsite blood magic is historical fact, not myth; official ban in place for decades but may be returning.\n\nFully recovered after grooming and rest—coat restored to gleaming silver-white, energy renewed. Alert and protective, monitoring for threats.\n\nPositioned herself outside cottage as guard during Rance/Talia's intimacy—attempted privacy but bond meant she sensed everything. Mixed emotions: concern about timing/complications, understanding of their need, reluctant fascination at Talia's responses. STANCE-Talia: Maintained vigil outside; couldn't fully shield from Companion's emotional overflow during sex; witnessed Queen's Own's complete transformation.",
