Commitment: ordered Senta to knock him out if he loses control near leadership. Status: arrived Haven as new Herald-Chosen; deemed dangerous wild talent by Healers.\n\nSTATUS: Herald-trainee officially; quartered at Healer's cottage in Companion's Field for safety.

STANCE-Rance: unconditional love through Choice bond; frustrated by his stubbornness and self-destructive behavior; protective; shares purpose to reach Haven and train his Gift\n\nSuspicion confirmed: Gift likely rarer/more dangerous than Firestarting; unprecedented in 5 centuries; no one capable of training him. Assessment: Rance thinks like Herald already; shows military-level tactical analysis beyond village headman norm. Journey: maintained tireless 4-day pace to Haven without real rest; exhausted on arrival but refused to leave Chosen's side. Met Rolan (Queen's Own Companion) on arrival.\n\nREALIZATION: Rance has raw wild Mage-Gift—kind not seen since Vanyel's time; understands he rewrote magical theory within days of Choosing. STANCE-Rance: Protective during Circle meeting; proud of his practical leadership; concerned about political tightrope; dry humor about expecting complications but not this scale; steady anchor through extraordinary events; accepts their life won't be dull Circuit routes.\n\nFully recovered after grooming and rest; coat gleaming, energy restored.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: concerned about untrained Mage-Gift use (door slam, potential fire lighting); maintains physical distance during intimate moments but cannot fully shield through bond; pragmatic about time constraints. STANCE-Talia: protective; understands she needed vulnerability/surrender after years of isolation.",

Physical disorientation continues—reaches for his memories that are now fragments; stride length mismatch when walking.\n\nSTATE: virginity taken by Rance; bite mark on breast; physically marked.
