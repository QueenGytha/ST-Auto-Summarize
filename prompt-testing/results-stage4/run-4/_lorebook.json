    "content": "Companion mare, unpartnered for 3 years until now. CHOSE Rance after his Gift destroyed Lisle—recognized wild talent danger immediately. STANCE-Rance: bonded as Chosen/Companion; protective yet exasperated by his stubbornness; stabilizing his burned-open channels through bond; firm that he must survive journey to Haven. Knows he caused the destruction himself; he doesn't yet accept this. Sharp-minded tactician; noted red robes suggest organized threat beyond bandits.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: warmed by his unexpected affection and nuzzling; will knock him out if he loses control per his instruction; impressed by his military assessment and pragmatism. Revealed Rance's Gift likely unprecedented—not seen in five centuries, more dangerous than Firestarting; no one capable of training it exists. Suspects Karsite blood magic involvement—stories hold historical truth. Made four-day relentless journey to Haven without proper rest; exhausted but refused separation from Chosen upon arrival. Met by Rolan (Queen's Own Companion) at Collegium; Healers took Rance.\n\nSTATE: Fully recovered—groomed, rested, energy restored after hard journey. STANCE-Rance: No regret about Choosing him despite unprecedented complications; fierce protectiveness mixed with exhausted humor about his chaos ('rewrite magical theory and give me heart failure'); values small moments of normalcy grooming provides; believes his leadership experience justifies Choice timing regardless of age. Monitors for threats; detects Talia's emotional shift to resolved determination.\n\nWitnessed/experienced through bond Rance's intimacy with Talia despite attempting privacy; maintained physical guard outside cottage. STANCE-Rance: Resigned acceptance of complications; concerned about timing/propriety but understands Talia's need; dry humor about situation ('at least no one can accuse you of being predictable'); cautioned about untrained Mage-Gift use (door slam). Observations: Talia discovering aspects of self hidden even in memory-merge; finding release in surrender after years of responsibility; relationship settles question of what they are to each other. Pragmatic focus on approaching Selenay meeting.",
