Mental channels burned open, severe Gift-shock but stabilizing via Companion bond. Chosen by Senta. Physical: exhausted, vision impaired but recovering, channels agonizingly raw. Carrying red robe hood wrapped around bandit blade as evidence. Now Herald-trainee bound for Haven.\n\nGift-shock collapsed him into unconscious sleep for three days straight. Committed to contingency: ordered Senta to knock him out if he loses control; fears accidentally killing Queen/Circle.\n\nPossesses complete memory-merge with Talia—all her life experiences, training, state secrets, shielding techniques, protocol knowledge, intimate court details. Can use her Empathy training concepts through untrained channels. Status: Herald-trainee (official cover); actual Mage-Gift wielder with Queen's Own-level knowledge. Assigned quarters: Healer's cottage in Companion's Field (containment precaution).",

STANCE-Rance: Chose him—bond absolute, protective, exasperated by his stubbornness. Recognizes his Gift as unprecedented threat/asset. Determined to get him to Haven alive, stabilize his channels. Practical, witty, dignified (deeply offended at being called 'horse'). Leading him to Waystation first for herb treatment.\n\nSuspects Rance's Gift unprecedented in ~500 years—rarer/more dangerous than Firestarting, no one capable of training him. Confirmed Karsite blood magic historically real, officially banned for decades. Maintained tireless pace three days straight to Haven (record time); exhausted but refused to leave Rance's side upon arrival.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: pride in his political/strategic thinking; concern over his casual impossibilities; protective during Circle meeting. Positioned herself at his side throughout Circle meeting alongside Rolan—symbolic dual-Companion endorsement.\n\nFully recovered after grooming and rest—coat gleaming, energy restored. Alert and protective, monitoring for threats (Alberich, political complications). Reads Talia's emotional shift as significant.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: Resigned acceptance of complicated bond; maintains physical distance during intimacy but cannot fully shield through Companion-bond; pragmatic about unprecedented situation. Witnessed/sensed Talia's transformation; concerned about timing constraints and political complications.",
