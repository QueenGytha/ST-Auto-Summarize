Practical, occasionally indignant, wry humor.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: growing attachment and protectiveness; matches his stubbornness; won't leave his side. Believes his Gift is rarer/more dangerous than Firestarting—possibly unprecedented in 500 years, no one capable of training him. Suspects Karsite blood magic involvement (captives for ritual sacrifice). Promised to knock Rance out if he loses control.\n\nMade contingency to knock Rance unconscious if he loses Gift control. STANCE-Rance: protective; concerned about political dangers; pride mixed with worry over his impossible feats; exasperated by his spite-driven rule-breaking.\n\nSTANCE-Rance: fierce protectiveness; admiration for leadership under uncertainty; monitors threats to him constantly.\n\nExperienced entire sexual encounter through unavoidable bond with Talia; reactions: embarrassment, concern about timing, reluctant fascination, pragmatic worry. STANCE-Rance: Accepts relationship has become intensely complicated; resigned understanding mixed with concern; maintains supportive role despite discomfort witnessing intimacy.",
