Gift-shock from violently awakened Mage-Gift (immensely powerful, type uncertain, possibly Firestarting-adjacent)—mental channels burned open, causing white-hot agony and inability to control magical awareness. Vision blurry, barely functional. Possesses red robe hood/blade as evidence.\n\nIDENTITY: Newly Chosen by Senta; Herald-trainee (official cover). STATE: Physically stable post-Gift manifestation; possesses complete memory-merge with Talia (all state secrets, training, protocol, personal history). GIFT: Mage-Gift—first manifestation leveled Lisle; energy blast capability; untrained but demonstrating unprecedented control. COMMITMENT: Contingency with Senta to be knocked unconscious if loses control. PUBLIC POSITION: Assigned healer's cottage in Companion's Field for safety/discretion; officially 'trainee like any other' to buy time.",

    "content": "White Companion mare, sapphire eyes, silver mane. Adult status 3 years, unpartnered until now. STANCE-Rance: Chose him despite his age/bitterness; bond formed—provides unconditional love, mental stabilization of ragged channels, knowledge of what he is; frustrated by his stubbornness but committed; shares purpose to reach Haven and train his Gift. Recognized red robes indicate organized threat beyond ordinary bandits.\n\nExhausted from three-day non-stop run to Haven but refused rest to stay with Chosen. Confirmed knowledge: Herald-Mages are historical fact; Karsite blood magic is real history, officially banned for decades. Instructed Rance on Gift-shock treatment (willow bark/valerian/comfrey mixture). Monitored his unconscious state throughout journey—stable but fragile, mind slowly mending. Made contingency agreement: will knock Rance out if he loses control. Avoided main thoroughfares when possible to minimize attention.\n\nSTATE: Exhausted from hard travel; coat dulled with road dust and sweat; awaiting promised grooming. STANCE-Rance: Protective; impressed by his pragmatism and leadership; exasperated by his spite-driven impossible feats; proud of contingency planning. ROLE: Enforcing knockout contingency if needed; refusing separation during procedures; monitoring Gift responses; providing steady support through bond. OBSERVATIONS: Recognized Mage-Gift first; warned about Talia's Empathy reach; counseled diplomatic caution with Circle.\n\nPHYSICAL: Fully recovered after thorough grooming and night's rest; coat restored to gleaming silver-white. STANCE-Rance: Comfortable physical intimacy (grooming ritual established). Monitoring for threats; noted Talia's emotional state shift from vulnerable to resolved/controlled overnight.\n\nSTATE: Maintained physical distance during coupling but couldn't fully shield from bond—experienced intensity of both participants' emotions despite discomfort. Witnessed Talia's complete transformation and surrender. STANCE-Rance: Concerned about untrained Mage-Gift use (door slam, curtain closure via telekinesis). STANCE-Talia: Surprised by Talia's response to dominance/degradation; recognizes this surrender provides release from constant responsibility.",

MERGE AFTERMATH: Experienced Rance's Lisle memories directly; he worked through her buried trauma (arranged marriage escape, Empathy awakening, isolation, fear of losing identity, crushing responsibility as Queen's Own); first time allowing true vulnerability; walls between compartmentalized self dissolving. STANCE-Rance: Complete mutual knowledge from merge; he knows her deepest fears/secrets including wine preferences; intimacy of shared consciousness (kiss broke connection); conflicted emotions—violation yet gratitude, fear yet fascination; he promised to share burdens she carried alone. CAPABILITY: Full recovery expected; currently unable to perform Queen's Own duties.\n\nINTERNAL SHIFT: Overnight reached definitive decision about handling memory-sharing situation; emotional state transformed from vulnerable/uncertain to controlled/determined/resolved. Experiencing disorientation from fragmented access to Rance's memories (waking reaching for memories that aren't fully there; stride-length mismatch). STANCE-Rance: Seeks his counsel before presenting decision to Selenay; treats as collaborative rather than subordinate despite rank difference. Decision 'potentially changes everything about how we proceed' and 'concerns both of us.'\n\nIDENTITY: Lost virginity to Rance—physical evidence (bite mark on breast, soreness, his seed inside her) will be hidden beneath Whites when meeting Selenay. STATE: Discovered she's aroused by degradation/submission—specifically being called 'Holderkin bitch/slut,' treated as vessel/property; conflicts with Queen's Own dignity but provides profound release from responsibility. Holderkin upbringing vocabulary enables her degradation fantasies. Two intense orgasms; first time experiencing this loss of control. Post-coital clarity returning but fundamentally changed. Ready to present co-advisor arrangement to Selenay while concealing intimate dimension.",
