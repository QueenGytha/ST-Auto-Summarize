Used intimate wine preference detail to prove merge authenticity. Delivered strategic military-style briefing. Stance/Talia: Intimate knowledge of her entire life including buried trauma. Helped her process decades of repressed pain during merge. Kissed her to close mental connection. Protective—wants to comfort/shield her, frustrated he can't stay with her.
