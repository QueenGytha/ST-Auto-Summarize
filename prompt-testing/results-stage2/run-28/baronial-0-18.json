He demanded complete honesty from staff about the estate's true condition. After receiving devastating reports on demographics, resources, and threats, Kordas confessed through song that his military fame was built on accidents and luck, not skill. Staff initially shocked, then laughed, then expressed greater confidence in his honesty than they would have in a false legend. Key dynamic established: complete transparency between Kordas and staff, no illusions.",

What to do with 150 bits and 7 months until winter with impossible odds. Whether 'lucky chaos' leadership can actually save a dying frontier estate. Vesper reports something with intelligence is directing Everfree incursions - two merchant caravans found empty, two scout pairs never returned.",
      "state": "Estate population: 340 ponies (280 earth, 40 pegasi, 20 unicorns), median age 38, youth leaving. Treasury: 150 bits (enough until harvest if nothing goes wrong). Military: 12 professional guards, 4 Night Watch, 40 militia. Weather team: 6 pegasi (should be 10). Everfree incursions: 17 within 5 miles in past month vs 9 last year same period. Kordas repurposed his two riding horses for field work immediately."
