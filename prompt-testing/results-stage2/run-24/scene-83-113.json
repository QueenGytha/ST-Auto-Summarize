Talia was a virgin; the encounter was intense and psychologically complex, involving degradation play rooted in her Holderkin trauma. They decided to formalize their connection to Selenay as Co-Advisors (or similar), but Rance argued to keep it secret except to Selenay and the Circle - public knowledge would raise questions about the Queen's Own unlocking trauma-sealed memories, leading to Lisle, the border situation, and his Mage-Gift.",

Rance's untrained Mage-Gift is dangerously unpredictable - he used it telekinetically during the scene despite the pain to his raw channels. The longer his Gift stays hidden, the better.",
      "state": "Talia and Rance's intimate relationship is now established, settling what they are to each other but massively complicating their political situation. Talia is preparing to meet with Selenay. Physical evidence of their encounter exists (bite mark hidden under Whites, stained bedding).

She admitted needing a partner who understands not just her position's burdens, but her - someone who can share what no one else has been permitted to see. Rance can stabilize her shields when they waver, correcting them with gentle mind connection. During their first sexual encounter, she found release in degrading herself using her Holderkin background - called herself 'dirty Holderkin slut,' 'worthless cunt,' 'just a hole to use,' 'a vessel.' Rance calling her 'Holderkin bitch' during climax triggered her first orgasm violently, breaking his command for silence with the profanity 'F-fuck!'
