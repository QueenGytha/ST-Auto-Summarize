      "outcomes": "Kordas arrived at Willowmere Manor as new Baron and immediately established radical transparency with his staff. He cancelled the welcome feast to preserve resources, insisted on honest assessment of the estate's dire situation, and confessed through self-deprecating song that his famous military victories were actually accidents. Rather than losing confidence, the staff rallied around his honesty, viewing it as refreshing compared to previous leadership. Kordas repurposed his two riding horses for field work as an immediate practical action.",

How to address escalating Everfree threat (17 incursions in past month vs 9 last year, coordinated behavior suggesting intelligent direction, two merchant caravans found empty, scout pairs missing) with insufficient forces. What to do with 150 bits and 7 months until winter. Whether 'lucky chaos' leadership can actually save a dying frontier estate. What is stirring in the Everfree depths - Vesper reports 'old magic,' howls that aren't wolves, whispers in ancient languages.",
      "state": "Estate population: 340 ponies (280 earth, 40 pegasi, 20 unicorns), median age 38, youth leaving for opportunities elsewhere. Treasury: 150 bits (enough until harvest if nothing goes wrong). Military: 12 professional guards, 4 bat pony Night Watch, 40 militia. Weather team: 6 pegasi (should be 10). Political isolation: Count Thornford hostile, Baroness Stormridge sympathetic but has griffon problems, Duke Meadowvale views frontier holdings as expendable buffers. Young ponies leaving for: twice the pay, safety, advancement, education, culture. Key dynamic established: complete honesty between Kordas and staff, no illusions."
