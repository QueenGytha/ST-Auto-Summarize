Lisle attack evidence: red-robed figures (Karsite features despite Menmellith misdirection), organized prisoner-taking instead of killing (requires effort/risk), suggests possible revival of blood magic practices. Border implications: Lisle near three-nation border; enough interaction for Rance to recognize Karsite features."
