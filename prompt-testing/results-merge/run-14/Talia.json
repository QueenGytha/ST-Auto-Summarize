Her entire life now known to him: arranged marriage escape, untrained Empathy nearly driving her mad, buried trauma from never learning to share burdens, constant fear of losing identity to Gift, self-doubt about worthiness as Queen's Own. Rance guided her through confronting deeply walled trauma—first time truly vulnerable, accepting help. Currently with Healer Crescent, overwhelmed but in better emotional state than before merge. Recovery expected. STANCE-Rance: Profound intimacy from shared consciousness. He kissed her to close mental connection. Conflicted—feels violated yet grateful, fascinated yet professionally concerned. Recognizes his untrained power prevented catastrophic damage that should have killed them both."
