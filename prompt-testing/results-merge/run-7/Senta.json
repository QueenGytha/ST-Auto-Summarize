STANCE-Rance: bonded as Chosen/Companion; protective yet exasperated by his stubbornness; stabilizing his burned-open channels through bond; firm that he must survive journey to Haven. Knows he caused the destruction himself; he doesn't yet accept this. Sharp-minded tactician; noted red robes suggest organized threat beyond bandits."
