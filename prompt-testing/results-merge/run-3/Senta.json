Arc: Drew toward devastation by the Call; found Rance collapsed in crater surrounded by wild magic residue; recognized Gift-shock and uncontrolled awakening; Chose him despite his age, bitterness, and catastrophic first manifestation—'There is only the right Chosen for each Companion.' Relationship with Rance: Chose him after he examined evidence; bond formed when eyes locked—her mindvoice 'clear as crystal bells, warm as summer sunshine'; poured unconditional love into him, stabilized his fracturing mind with mental bridges across burned channels; revealed he caused the destruction himself; frustrated by his stubbornness (insulted when he called her 'horse,' irritated when he insisted on examining bodies, nipped his shoulder to get attention); accepts his determination but insists on Waystation stop for herbs/rest; their bond already stabilizing his wild Gift; shares his purpose to warn Haven. Abilities: Mind-speech with Chosen; can travel three times distance of ordinary horses; heightened magical senses."
