      "content": "Identity: 40-year-old former headman of Lisle; skilled rider with possible military background; stoic, pragmatic, stubborn to the point of self-destruction. State: Newly awakened immensely powerful Mage-Gift (unknown type, possibly Firestarting)—burned open mental channels cause white-hot agony, blurred vision, teetering sanity; Gift-shock severe; physically exhausted but forcing himself through sheer willpower. Arc: Witnessed entire village destroyed and people carried off during bandit attack; believes others caused destruction—doesn't yet fully accept he did it himself; driven by duty to warn Haven despite trauma; initially dismissed Senta as 'insufferable horse,' called her for mercy killing. Relationship with Senta: Chosen by her—bond snapped into place when their eyes locked; her unconditional love and mental bridges stabilized his fracturing mind enough to survive; accepts bond pragmatically ('I'm in no position to argue') but resists her care ('If you tire, I'll drag you'); their connection allows mind-speech though it pains his ragged channels. Evidence gathered: Red robes hidden under bandit clothing; suspects organized sect, not simple bandits; tracks lead toward Menmellith."
