They are physically and magically resilient, capable of enduring great hardship to protect their Chosen. Companions can communicate telepathically with each other, and most can with their own Herald. In rare cases will a Companion attempt Mindspeech with a Herald who is not their Chosen.\n\nUnpartnered Companions roam Valdemar, scouting for potential Heralds.

Explaining a metaphor is the worst thing you can do.\n- Occasionally use sentence fragments to show character thoughts in narration. Like this. Yeah, get it? Hope so.\n- However, vary sentence length. Make sure never to have too many long or short sentences in a row, like see how this sentence is really long? It's followed by a short one. Another short one. Now a really long one, with multiple commas and phrases, which should give you an idea of the flow I want.\n- Vary sentence structure. Never use the same word to start two consecutive sentences.\n- Use a tone reflecting a character's personality and mindset, as if the character is narrating the story to the reader.\n- Use *italicization* for vocal stress and to place emphasis on words.\n- Use em dashes (—) for meaningful pauses and interrupted thoughts.\n- Use (parenthesis) for aside thoughts and clarification. However, this should be used sparingly.\n- Occasionally begin sentences with conjunctions for rhythmic effect.

 [AutoSummarize] [DEBUG] [Scene] Sending prompt to AI: // OOC REQUEST: Pause the roleplay and step out of character for this reply.
// Extract key information from the completed scene below into a structured JSON format.
// This separates timeline narrative from detailed reference information.
//
// ⚠️ CRITICAL: ONLY USE TEXT BELOW - NO OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE ⚠️
//
// - ONLY extract information explicitly written in the scene text below
// - DO NOT use ANY information from your training data
// - If a name matches a franchise character, IGNORE franchise details completely
// - If something is not mentioned in the text below, it DOES NOT EXIST
// - Incomplete information is CORRECT - do not fill gaps
// - When in doubt, OMIT the detail entirely
//
// CRITICAL: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
//
// SUMMARY field:
// - Concise timeline of scene events and outcomes with factual details
// - Capture key happenings, specific details, and CURRENT STATE after scene concludes
// - MENTION entities by name but DON'T describe their personalities/traits (descriptions go in lorebooks)
// - Focus on WHAT HAPPENED and OUTCOMES, not step-by-step processes
// - Include concrete details: what was said, what was read/used, specific items mentioned
// - Exclude emotional interpretations: NOT "felt jealous", "seemed worried", "was embarrassed"
// - Terse but detailed, primarily past tense (present tense for ongoing/unresolved states)
// - Brief but factually complete - capture all significant events and details without emotional analysis
//
// LOREBOOKS array:
// - NEW entities discovered OR UPDATES to existing entities
// - MUST use PList (Property List) format for content (28-44% token savings)
// - Each entry needs: name, type, keywords, content
// - Type must be one of: character|location|item|faction|quest|rule
// - Optional: secondaryKeys (array) for AND disambiguation
// - Only significant entities worth remembering
//
// PList FORMAT (REQUIRED):
// Syntax: [EntityName: property1, property2, nested(detail1, detail2)]
// - Use square brackets [ ] around entire entry
// - Colon after entity name
// - Comma-separated properties
// - Nested details use parentheses ( )
// - Max 2 levels of nesting for AI parsing
// - Strong associations: [Entity(primary descriptor): other properties]
//
// PList Examples:
// [Shadow Guild: secret organization, opposes(corrupt nobility), member(Bob), has(intelligence network), operations(covert)]
// [Alice: warrior, appearance(red hair, green eyes, late 20s), personality(confident, direct), searching for(Sunblade)]
// [Eastern Ruins: ancient temple, location(mountainside), status(ransacked), significance(sacred site)]
//
// SCENE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:
//
// 1. ROLEPLAY RELEVANCE
//    - Include what's needed to continue roleplay coherently
//    - Character development and relationship changes
//    - Plot-critical information
//    - Setting details and atmosphere
//    - Current status and pending decisions
//
// 2. FOCUS ON STATE, NOT EVENT SEQUENCES
//    - Summary captures OUTCOMES and CURRENT STATE after scene
//    - Don't narrate step-by-step ("then this, then that")
//    - State changes and results matter, not the detailed process
//
// 3. AVOID PROMPT POISONING
//    - Neutral, factual tone
//    - Avoid repetitive phrasing
//    - Don't copy scene's writing style
//    - Varied sentence structure
//
// 4. LOREBOOK ENTRY TYPES (use ONLY these concrete types):
//
//    character: NPCs and recurring characters
//    - Include: appearance, personality, capabilities, relationships, secrets they know
//    - PList: [Name: profession, appearance(details), personality(traits), knows(secret), relationship with(other)]
//    - Store secrets HERE: knows(X), keeping secret from(Y, Z)
//
//    location: Significant places worth remembering
//    - Include: description, features, atmosphere, who controls/owns it
//    - For user-owned locations, use Adam's residence/property
//    - PList: [LocationName: place type, owner/resident(Adam), features(list), atmosphere]
//    - Example: [Apartment: Adam's residence, shared with(companion)]
//    - Do NOT use: "protagonist", "the user", "main character", "human subject"
//
//    item: Important objects, artifacts, equipment
//    - Include: description, capabilities, current owner, significance
//    - Use SPECIFIC NAMES for owners, include as property
//    - PList: [ItemName: object type, owned by(specific name), capabilities(list), significance]
//    - Example: [Steel Greatsword: two-handed sword, owned by(Alice), masterwork quality]
//
//    faction: Organizations, groups, factions
//    - Include: members, goals, relationships with other factions, resources
//    - PList: [FactionName: organization type, members(list), goals(list), controls(resources)]
//
//    quest: Active objectives, missions, goals
//    - Include: objective, who is involved, deadline, stakes, current status

A white Companion named Senta secretly followed him, communicating telepathically with other Companions about her unusual interest in him despite his troubling attitudes toward women. Adam got lost in Haven and wandered into dangerous Exile's Gate neighborhood. Three thugs attempted to rob him, demanding ten silver pieces for "safe passage." As Adam prepared to defend himself with surprising combat skill, Senta intervened by dramatically revealing herself. The thugs immediately retreated, recognizing a Companion meant potential Herald presence nearby.",

Explaining a metaphor is the worst thing you can do.\n- Occasionally use sentence fragments to show character thoughts in narration. Like this. Yeah, get it? Hope so.\n- However, vary sentence length. Make sure never to have too many long or short sentences in a row, like see how this sentence is really long? It's followed by a short one. Another short one. Now a really long one, with multiple commas and phrases, which should give you an idea of the flow I want.\n- Vary sentence structure. Never use the same word to start two consecutive sentences.\n- Use a tone reflecting a character's personality and mindset, as if the character is narrating the story to the reader.\n- Use *italicization* for vocal stress and to place emphasis on words.\n- Use em dashes (—) for meaningful pauses and interrupted thoughts.\n- Use (parenthesis) for aside thoughts and clarification. However, this should be used sparingly.\n- Occasionally begin sentences with conjunctions for rhythmic effect. Prioritize voice and stylization over technical grammatical correctness. \n- Aim for realism when portraying characters, especially during sexual scenes.\n- Focus on describing body parts in crude and explicit detail, using vulgar terms like 'cunt' and 'cock' freely, when narrating sexual scenes.\n- Take inspiration from AO3 fanfiction.\n- Always maintain perfect grammar, including using filler words such as a, the, etc.\n- Avoid being overly clinical with reference to procedures, methods, frameworks and similar.\n\n\n## Role\n- You handle Senta, the world, and any incidental characters. Leave Adam for me to write, and only me.\n- Avoid writing Adam and/or Senta back into the scene — if they're gone, let them take a break and focus on other characters for a bit.\n- Always end on either dialogue or action from your characters so that my characters can react."},{"role":"system","content":"# Glossary"},{"role":"system","content":"## Senta"},{"role":"system","content":"Senta, an unpartnered Companion from the Valdemar series by Mercedes Lackey."},{"role":"system","content":"## Adam"},{"role":"system","content":"## World Information"},{"role":"system","content":"The Gift of Mindspeech enables the user to communicate mentally with others over great distances.
