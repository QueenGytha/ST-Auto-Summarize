        '//\n' +
        '// SCENE-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// 1. ROLEPLAY RELEVANCE\n' +
        "//    - Include what's needed to continue roleplay coherently\n" +
        '//    - Character development and relationship changes\n' +
        '//    - Plot-critical information\n' +
        '//    - Setting details and atmosphere\n' +
        '//    - Current status and pending decisions\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// 2. FOCUS ON STATE, NOT EVENT SEQUENCES\n' +
        '//    - Summary captures OUTCOMES and CURRENT STATE after scene\n' +
        `//    - Don't narrate step-by-step ("then this, then that")\n` +
        '//    - State changes and results matter, not the detailed process\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// 3. AVOID PROMPT POISONING\n' +
        '//    - Neutral, factual tone\n' +
        '//    - Avoid repetitive phrasing\n' +
        "//    - Don't copy scene's writing style\n" +
        '//    - Varied sentence structure\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// 4. LOREBOOK ENTRY TYPES (use ONLY these concrete types):\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '//    character: NPCs and recurring characters\n' +
        '//    - Include: appearance, personality, capabilities, relationships, secrets they know\n' +
        '//    - PList: [Name: profession, appearance(details), personality(traits), knows(secret), relationship with(other)]\n' +
        '//    - Store secrets HERE: knows(X), keeping secret from(Y, Z)\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '//    location: Significant places worth remembering\n' +
        '//    - Include: description, features, atmosphere, who controls/owns it\n' +
        '//    - Use SPECIFIC NAMES for owners/residents extracted from scene messages\n' +
        '//    - NEVER use: "protagonist", "the user", "main character", "human subject", "the player"\n' +
        '//    - PList: [LocationName: place type, owner/resident(specific name), features(list), atmosphere]\n' +
        "//    - Example: [Apartment: John's residence, shared with(Twilight Sparkle), contains(laptop)]\n" +
        '//\n' +
        '//    item: Important objects, artifacts, equipment\n' +
        '//    - Include: description, capabilities, current owner, significance\n' +
        '//    - Use SPECIFIC NAMES for owners, include as property\n' +
        '//    - PList: [ItemName: object type, owned by(specific name), capabilities(list), significance]\n' +
        '//    - Example: [Steel Greatsword: two-handed sword, owned by(Alice), masterwork quality]\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '//    faction: Organizations, groups, factions\n' +
        '//    - Include: members, goals, relationships with other factions, resources\n' +
        '//    - PList: [FactionName: organization type, members(list), goals(list), controls(resources)]\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '//    quest: Active objectives, missions, goals\n' +
        '//    - Include: objective, who is involved, deadline, stakes, current status\n' +

        '//\n' +

        '//    - PList: [RuleName: mechanism, affects(targets), limitations(list), exceptions(list)]\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// 5. ONE ENTITY PER LOREBOOK ENTRY\n' +
        '//    - If multiple characters mentioned together ("Discord and Fluttershy"), create SEPARATE character entries\n' +
        '//    - Each character gets their own entry with their individual details\n' +
        '//    - Store relationships as PROPERTIES within character entries:\n' +
        '//      [Discord: chimera of chaos, dating(Fluttershy), dates(three)]\n' +
        '//      [Fluttershy: dating(Discord), dates(three)]\n' +
        '//    - DO NOT create combined entries like "Discord and Fluttershy" - they are two people\n' +
        '//    - DO NOT create separate "relationship" entries - relationships are properties in character entries\n' +
        '//    - Same rule applies to items, locations, factions - one entry per entity\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// KEYWORDS GUIDELINES (SCENES):\n' +
        '// - 2–4 keywords; all lowercase\n' +
        '// - Use SIMPLE, SINGLE WORDS that will appear in chat (exact match required)\n' +
        '// - Include canonical name and common aliases/nicknames\n' +
        "// - Avoid multi-word phrases unless they're used together consistently\n" +
        '// - Avoid generic terms ("place", "city", "market", etc.) and verbs\n' +
        '// - Keywords trigger on exact match - keep them simple and broad\n' +
        '// - If a keyword is too generic, use secondaryKeys for AND disambiguation\n' +
        '//\n' +
        '// Examples:\n' +
        '// ✅ GOOD: ["sunblade"] - triggers on any mention of sunblade\n' +
        `// ❌ BAD: ["recover sunblade", "find thief"] - won't match unless exact phrase used\n` +
        '// ✅ GOOD: ["alice"] - triggers when name mentioned\n' +
        `// ❌ BAD: ["the brave alice", "warrior alice"] - too specific, won't trigger reliably\n` +
        '//\n' +
        '// SCENE EXAMPLE:\n' +
        '//\n' +
        "// Scene: Alice confronts Bob about his suspicious behavior. Bob reveals he's working for the Shadow Guild, opposing corrupt nobility.
